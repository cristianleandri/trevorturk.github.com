dive into mark <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">Freedom 0 </a> says it pretty well. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about money; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about freedom. In regard to the switch from <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">MoveableType</a> to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. I also swtiched because the program is better, but that is neither here nor there.
