I'm back in Chicago again and I'll be starting to look for a job while reading and sleeping. I'll update this site when I have something to say, but I doubt that will be very often. This website should go under a bit of a change soon, so that I can post my resume and stuff without feeling bad about it. I sort of miss Cambridge, where I was on the BUNAC program with Jordan (<a href="http://www.bunac.org.uk">www.bunac.org.uk</a>) for six months, but I think I'll miss Jordan more. Aww. Anyway, going around Italy afterwords was fun, but I am very tired now. I'm not sure what my plans are, but I'm thinking about going to Long Beach in California to live with Scott for a while, maybe go to Australia for the 4 month BUNAC thing, maybe visit Badger on his Teaching English in Japan deal, maybe visit the folks in Florida soon. I'm still looking into Law School, but I'm not sure if I really want to do it yet. We'll see, I guess. I'll probably update this as I update the webpage to make it look nice.
