I was frustrated with the amount of duplicated code sprinkled in my models that are using the <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/2007/03/25/working-with-attachment_fu/">attachment_fu</a> plugin to deal with file uploads. It's not like I need to write a plugin or anything fancy - I just want to be a little more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. 

So, how does one simply share code between <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord</a> models? It's actually quite easy.

First, drop some code into a module in a .rb file in your lib directory. For example:

<pre lang="ruby">
# lib/attachment_fu_extensions.rb

module AttachmentFuExtensions
  
  # include some standard attachment_fu stuff
  def self.included(klass)
    klass.send :validates_as_attachment
    klass.send :validates_uniqueness_of, :filename
    klass.send :validates_presence_of, :user_id
    klass.send :attr_protected, :id, :parent_id, :user_id, :created_at, :updated_at
  end

  # upload into a single directory (e.g. public/uploads) instead of subdirectories based on the id
  def full_filename(thumbnail = nil)
    file_system_path = (thumbnail ? thumbnail_class : self).attachment_options[:path_prefix].to_s
    File.join(RAILS_ROOT, file_system_path, thumbnail_name_for(thumbnail))
  end

  # prevent users from uploading index files that would be served instead of the index template/action
  def validate
    errors.add("filename", "is invalid") if filename? && %w(index.html index.htm).include?(filename.downcase)
  end

end
</pre>

That code will automatically be loaded when your application starts, provided that the filename and module follow the standard Rails <a href="http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2007/8/8/auto-load">naming conventions</a>. 

Then, simply include the relevant module in the relevant models. For example:

<pre lang="ruby">
# app/models/upload.rb

class Upload < ActiveRecord::Base
    
  has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/uploads', :max_size => 10.megabytes
  include AttachmentFuExtensions

  # ...

end
</pre>

That's it. Extending ActiveRecord models and DRYing out your app is pretty easy, eh? 

<b>Update:</b> <a href="http://kete.net.nz/">Walter</a> pointed out that I should put modules like this into lib/ instead of config/initializers/, so I've updated this post to reflect that. I'm not sure why that didn't occur to me. He also told me about the trick for sharing calls to validates_as_attachment and so forth - I didn't even know that was possible!
