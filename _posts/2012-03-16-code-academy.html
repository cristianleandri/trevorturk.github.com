I've been mentoring at <a href="codeacademy.org">Code Academy</a> and just did <a href="http://blog.codeacademy.org/post/19400078354/featured-mentor-trevor-turk">an interview</a> with one of the founders. Working with Code Academy students has been really fun and rewarding. If you're a Ruby developer in Chicago, you should consider being a mentor, too!
