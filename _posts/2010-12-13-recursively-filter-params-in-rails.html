So, I needed to recursively filter out some certain values from a params has provided by Rails. 

Here's how I did it:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/739412.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>

Is there a better way to do that? I'm not sure... If you have some clever ideas, fork that gist and do your worst.
