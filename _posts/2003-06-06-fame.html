Pacino's made some stinkers, sure, but he himself never, ever stinks. He seems to love acting, and love being a star. He takes bad movies (Any Given Sunday, The Recruit) and puts them on his shoulders, like some POW-rescuing commando in a Namsploitation flick. He hefts the picture on his back, shouts "Hoo-wah!," and drags it all out of the swamp.
