<a title="Seth Godin: Author, Agent of Change" href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin: Author, Agent of Change</a> has written a book about marketing... or maybe it's about making products that market themselves... or maybe it's just about some interesting products. Here are the ones that I liked, and thought I would share:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zappos.com">Zappos, the Amazon.com of shoes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.chefn.com">Chefn, cheesy TV products that people actually like</a></li><li><a href="http://www.firstclassflyer.com">FirstClassFlyer, for people who fly a lot</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.veer.com">Veer, stock graphics and photos that look good</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.firebox.com">Firebox, toys and stuff like that</a></li></ul>
If you want more about the author, you can read this <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/67/purplecow.html">article</a> and see some sample chapters from the book.
