I&#8217;m in the middle of moving this site over to a new host and CMS, that being <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. It&#8217;s going to take me a couple days to get everything over to this new setup, and a lot of stuff is likely to get moved around. I&#8217;m putting in a new photo gallery via <a href="http://www.photostack.org/">PhotoStack</a>, and now that I&#8217;ve got 500mb thanks to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">DreamHost</a>, I should be able to put up a lot more junk for nobody to look at! Hooray! There is going to be quite a bit of hubbub for a while (what with all the moving), so check back in a week or something - ok?
