<blockquote>This is the first of what I hope to be several examples of using OAuth as a developer. Our OAuth server implementation is in open beta and I want to show an example of how to use it. As the implementation is still in beta, feedback is appreciated as you begin your integration. If all goes well I'll post on using OAuth from other languages in the future.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>I'm bookmarking this because it taught me something I managed to not learn in spite of having had a slug on my home network for over a year now. To wit: if you bork your network setup, reboot your slug and find that you can no longer dial in with SSH, simply power it down, pull the USB drive you're using as /, slot it up in another machine and edit your slug's conf files in your favorite editor. Nice.</blockquote></p>
