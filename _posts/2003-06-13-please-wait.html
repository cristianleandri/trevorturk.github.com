I'm stealing <a title="The Cellphones We Ought to Have" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/12/technology/circuits/12POGUE-EMAIL.html?pagewanted=print&position=">The Cellphones We Ought to Have</a> straight from <a href="http://www.37signal.com/svn">SvN</a> but i think this is a really really good idea - for any phone:
<blockquote>
"Please hold" message -- When a cellphone rings, you usually have two options: Answer it or send it to voicemail. But there should be a third button that answers the call but plays a message like this: "Please hold while the owner of this phone tries to find a place where answering your call won't annoy everyone else in the room."
</blockquote>
