I am pleased to announce that I got a new computer the other day. I've been using it to get some work done on this site, as you might be able to tell. It's a Dell Inspiron 8600, with the widescreen and the CD/DVD burner. Pretty nice, me thinks. I need to get a mouse, though, because this little touchpad thing is pretty hard to use. I'm not sure about the battery life, but it's got that new centrino thing going that is supposed to help. Anywhoot, I should be making more updates to this site now that I actually have a computer. Can you believe a computer dork like me went without an actual computer for months and months?
