I'm pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/eldorado/">El Dorado</a> version 0.9.2 - the "group chat" edition. You can <a href="http://github.com/trevorturk/eldorado/tarball/v0.9.2">download it right away</a>, or check out the demo, testing, and support site here:

<a href="http://eldorado.heroku.com/">http://eldorado.heroku.com/</a>

Since we <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/2008/01/24/welcome-to-el-dorado/">last spoke</a> at the end of January, there's been a goodly amount of activity with El Dorado. The highlight, of course, is the new group chat feature:

This is a very <a href="http://github.com/trevorturk/eldorado/tree/master/app/controllers/messages_controller.rb">simple</a> and lightweight implementation that's perfect for small groups. It works solely with the tools provided by Rails and doesn't add anything to the overall requirements for running El Dorado. I've been using it with my group of friends for a few weeks now, and it's been working great. I'm sure that I'll have some more features to announce with the next release, but my favorite little touch so far is the "who's in the chat room and when was the chat last active" indicator on the home page:

In addition to the addition of group chat, there have been a number of improvements to other parts of the app and quite a bit of back-end optimization/refactoring. Here's a quick list of the new features:

<ul class="bullets">
<li>Make entire site private with a simple admin setting (great for small companies)</li>
<li>View all posts across the entire forum in reverse chronological order</li>
<li>View all posts by individual user</li>
<li>Upload new files quickly and easily via URL</li>
<li>Ability to "sticky" and "lock" forum threads</li>
<li>Move threads to different forums, and forums to different categories</li>
<li>Allow users to stay logged in between different browsers/machines</li>
<li>New calendar interface for setting the date/time of an event</li>
<li>Admin interface for viewing/editing/creating user rankings</li>
<li>Admin interface to grant/revoke admin privileges</li>
<li>Various BBCode additions (Flickr video, Slideshare, FunnyOrDie, etc) and some bug fixes</li>
</ul>

Of course, you can follow along with all of the activity in El Dorado on the <a href="http://github.com/trevorturk/el-dorado/commits/master">commit log</a> at github. You see, being the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/13/37signals-drives-another-company-to-the-deadpool/">lemming</a> that I am, I've followed Rails to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/4/11/rails-premieres-on-github">github</a> and <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/4/15/rails-and-family-on-lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> already. I haven't had time to settle into Lighthouse just yet, but I've been having a blast with git and github. 

In fact, I gave a presentation at <a href="http://chicagoruby.org/articles/2008/03/21/el-dorado-and-esod/">Chicago Ruby</a> and spent a fair amount of time talking about making the move to git. Definitely flip through <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/almosteffortless/eldo-chicagoruby.pdf">the PDF</a> to learn all about the origin of El Dorado (where the name came from, etc) but take my word for it about one thing: git/github is the way to go: 

<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/almosteffortless/eldo-chicagoruby.pdf"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/almosteffortless/eldo-chicagoruby.png" alt="eldo-chicagoruby" /></a>

If you believe the PDF, then the upcoming of releases should go something like this:

<ul class="bullets">
<li><strike>Chat</strike></li>
<li>Localization (see note below)</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Themes</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Wiki</li>
<li>Polls</li>
<li>Link Sharing</li>
<li>Mobile Messaging</li>
</ul>

Thanks to git/github, <a href="http://github.com/jxl">jxl</a> has been working on a <a href="http://github.com/jxl/el-dorado/tree/master">localized version of El Dorado using Gibberish</a>, and he's already completed a Dutch translation. I'll be working with him to pull his changes into my repo for the next release. If you're interested in translating El Dorado into another language, please do get in touch!

I think that about covers it... so... Welcome to El Dorado v.0.9.2!
