Moving a site to a new location can mean leaving a lot of broken links behind. However, you can use the "magic" of <b>htaccess</b> to redirect all traffic to your new site. Simply create a new text file in your favorite editor and paste in the following line:

<pre>ErrorDocument 404 http://www.example.com/</pre>

Of course, you'll have to replace the "example.com" address with whatever page you're trying to redirect the visitor to. Then, all you have to do is save the file as ".htaccess" and upload it to the folder where your site used to be. That's it! You can <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/htaccess.html">read more about htaccess</a> if you like, but it's pretty heady stuff, I must say.
