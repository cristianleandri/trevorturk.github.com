Since I recently shared this list of <b>Mac apps I use</b> with a friend, I thought I might share them here as well:

<a href="http://irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/">SizeUp</a> is the first thing I install on a new Mac. It's a fantastic window moving/resizing utility that I can't imagine living without.

Note that you can use Command+Tab to switch between active apps, that you can use a mouse to choose one more quickly, and that F3 is your friend. You can always use an app launcher to bypass window management altogether, though. I've configured Spotlight to only search Applications and Documents. Since I have an SSD, this setup seems fast enough. Some people swear by <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a>, <a href="http://quicksilver.en.softonic.com/mac">Quicksilver</a>, or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/">Google Quick Search Box</a>, though, and I think that's fine. No matter what you do, though, empty your dock and hide it. 

<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> is (still) the best text editor for the Mac. <a href=http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWranger</a> is a reasonable alternative, especially since it's free. 

<a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a> is a great password management app, but I'm mad at them because they're taking <i>forever</i> to support Chrome. 

<a href="http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/">Arq</a> is an easy to use backup app that stores your files on Amazon S3. It's not perfect (yet), but I love it.  

<a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> is great for simple image editing. <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a> is for chat. <a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a> is for irc.

Of course I use <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. 

<a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> is great for making websites into standalone apps. You can make one for Gmail and set that to be your default maito client. Highly recommended. 

<a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/">Gitx</a> is a good git gui for looking through changesets when you don't feel like opening up <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. 

<a href="http://tinygrab.com/">TinyGrab</a> is nice for sharing screenshots. <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> is for ftp. <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> has a Mac client. <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> is for Twitter. <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> is for bit torrent.

<a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope">xScope</a> is invaluable when designing webpages and/or graphics. 

So... that's a quick list of my "must have" Map apps. I hope you find them as valuable as I have.
