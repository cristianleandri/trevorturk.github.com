After seeing Matrix Reloaded last night, I'm feeling confused feelings. I'm going to do some spoiling, so don't read this if you haven't seen it. One question, what is the deal with Neo being able to use superpowers in the 'real world'? It seems to me that this means that where Zion is is actually still the Matrix. Like there is another Matrix for people who are not satisfied with the Matrix that was made to keep them occupied. Did that make sense? Anyway, I thought it was OK but not great. I agree with a lot of the things that <a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=15192">Ain't it cool news</a> said about it - for example, that the Burly Brawl scene with all of the Smiths was pretty much pointless. I mean, what did that accomplish? On the other hand, I do think the plot was pretty good if not a little too confusing. There is this corporate mofo <a href="http://www.corporatemofo.com/stories/051803matrix.htm">guide</a> that seems pretty cool (but even <i>that</i> confuses me. Plus, there are two other good discussions out there: <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/dave/">here</a> and <a href="http://johnc.haager.net/blog/archives/2003_05_16.html#000097">here</a>. In the end, I think the movie was good but obviously needs the third movie to make any real sense. Finally, one more site: <a href="http://matrixessays.blogspot.com/">Matrix Essays</a>. Oh, and <a title="What's So Bad about Living in the Matrix?" href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/new_phil_pryor.html">What's So Bad about Living in the Matrix?</a>
