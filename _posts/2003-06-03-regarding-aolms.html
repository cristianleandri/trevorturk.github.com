There have been a number of interesting things written about the deal between AOL and MS for 750 million dollars, and what that might do to Mozilla/Netscape, so I'll just link to them thusly: <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0503c.shtml#cnet">Zeldman</a> and <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1032_3-1011859.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news">Cnet</a> and <a href="http://news.com.com/2009-1032_3-1011363.html">a special report</a> and <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3226">Mozillazine</a>.
