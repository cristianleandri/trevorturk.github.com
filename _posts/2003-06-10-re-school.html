I have been really struggling lately with the idea of law school. On one hand, I think that going to school again would be a good idea. I think that a liberal arts degree from <a href="http://www.lawrence.edu">Lawrence University</a> (which just dropped to 50 on the top tier liberal arts schools) isn't going to get me "very far". But I'm having trouble with that idea. Where am I trying to <i>go</i>? That is a question that I need to answer before I figure out how to get there, right? But I need to get some post-graduate degree... I think.<br /><br /> On the other hand, I read things like <a title="Advice for the Lawlorn" href="http://www.nylawyer.com/lawlorn/">Advice for the Lawlorn</a> that make me second guess myself for even considering law school. I mean, who wants to work 70 hours a week - with no weekends free? To me, working hard in school is one thing, but <i>never</i> having time to rest or have fun (or at least free time) sounds a bit scary. Still, I am reading about it because - I admit it - law school sounds interesting. challenging. maybe rewarding. So I read <a href="http://www.nylawyer.com/lawlorn/96/ad112596.html">this</a> or <a href="http://www.nylawyer.com/wisdom/02/031402.html">that</a> on the same site mentioned above and think maybe I could do it. I actally <i>like</i> working hard, and wouldn't mind doing it for 7-10 years before slowing down. <br /><br />And yes, yet... I'll just keep reading what <a href="http://www.kaptest.com/repository/templates/Lev2InitDroplet.jhtml?_lev2Parent=/www/KapTest/docs/repository/content/Law">Kaplan</a> has to say on the subject, or <a href="http://advisingservices.ucdavis.edu/prelaw/prelaw_detail.html">what pre-law I should have done</a> and so on. And I know they all <i>say</i> that your GPA and LAST score aren't all they use to judge you, but then LSAC, the official law school admission service gives you this <a href="http://officialguide.lsac.org/search/cgi-bin/lsatgpa.asp?WhichScreen=KeywordSearch">LSAT/GPA Range Finder</a> that lists your chances of getting into schools based on... guess what. Then there are <a href="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/svp/carct/matrix.html">more</a> like that, so you read what the ABA (American Bar Association) has <a href="http://www.abanet.org/scripts/printview.jsp?Ref=http://www.abanet.org/legaled/prelaw/prep.html">to say</a> on the subject. And so you end up thinking about spending $1000 on a <a href="http://www.testpreprankings.com/">test prep course</a> so that you can boost your chances of getting into the position of going $100,000 in debt - I don't know if 'yikes' really captures the feeling. At the end of the day, maybe you wish you <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/school/2001/04/05/">hadn't gone to school in the first place</a>, and now your getting ready to dive right back in. What to do... what to do...
