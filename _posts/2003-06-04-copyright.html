Disney argues that all copyrights should be extended for twice as long so that they can save Mickey Mouse from going to the public domain. I won't even mention that Disney used characters and stories on the year that they entered into the public domain - but, I guess I already did. Anyway, there is a petition that you might want to sign regarding a law that would make copyright holders pay a small maintanence fee - <a title="The Eric Eldred Act" href="http://eldred.cc/">The Eric Eldred Act</a>. The idea is that people who are making money can keep on doing it, and other works can pass into the public domain as they were supposed to before they decompose (or whatever) and are lost forever! You can sign <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/eldred/petition.html">here</a> and read more about it on <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/cat_eldredcc.shtml">lessig.org</a> .
