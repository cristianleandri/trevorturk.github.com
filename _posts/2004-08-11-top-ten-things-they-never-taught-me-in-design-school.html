<blockquote>
1. Talent is one-third of the success equation.

2. 95 percent of any creative profession is shit work.

3. If everything is equally important, then nothing is very important.

4. Don't over-think a problem.

5. Start with what you know; then remove the unknowns.

6. Don't forget your goal.

7. When you throw your weight around, you usually fall off balance.

8. The road to hell is paved with good intentions; or, no good deed goes unpunished.

9. It all comes down to output.

10. The rest of the world counts.
