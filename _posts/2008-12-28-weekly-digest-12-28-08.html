<blockquote>It seems that we thoroughly caught the interwebs with surprise by announcing that Merb is being merged into Rails 3. 96% of the feedback seems to be very positive. People incredibly excited about us closing the rift and emerging as a stronger community.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>The flow of Merb ideas into Rails 3 is already under way. Let me walk you through one of the first examples that I've been working on the design for. Merb has a feature related to Rails' respond_to structure that works for the generic cases where you have a single object or collection that you want to respond with in different formats.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Why merge when we are about to win?! What does Merb win by being merged into Rails? Why not merge Rails into Merb? You are killing innovation by killing the competition.  You screwed us over and now I have to go “back” to Rails. Rails 3.0 won’t even be as good as Merb 1.x. &#9;The Rails team won’t let you do what you have to do to merge Merb into Rails. DHH is a jerk.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://usernamecheck.com/about">UserNameCheck.com</a>
<blockquote>This site is a quick and dirty solution to a question that I often lay awake at night worrying about. Do I have my username registered across every site that I should? What if the next internet humiliation meme just happens to share the username I've been using for years...</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle.jhtml?articleID=212501217">Chief Of The Year: Amazon CTO Werner Vogels</a>

<blockquote>I wouldn't go so far as some have gone and say that the G1 has a worse battery life than the first gen iPhones, but I can confirm that if you like auto-location intensive softs like loopt or are using the phone to navigate and plan on having it find your location more than a few times while navigating, you will beat the stock G1 battery to within an inch of its life in a matter of two or three hours. Odds are good that I'm going to order one of these.</blockquote></p>
