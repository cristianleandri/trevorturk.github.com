<blockquote>In addition to being a nice, clear explanation of what's going on with &quot;cupcake&quot;, the &quot;service pack&quot; upgrade for Android, this is also a good primer on exactly what the future of Android handsets is going to look like. For those wondering about whether total anarchy would ensue upon the arrival of a F/OSS mobile OS, the beginning of the answer is contained within this piece: it looks (as of right now) as though hardware manufacturers will begin with an Android &quot;image&quot;, or tag, modify it as necessary, release it and maintain it, importing features from fresh tags as they see fit.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>I can't personally vouch (this link came courtesy of LH), but if you've become accustomed to tearing the stuffing out of stock Windows installs within moments of product key activation, this website looks like it could be very handy: you search alphabetically for the DLL you're after and you're presented with version specific results. Excellent.</blockquote></p>
