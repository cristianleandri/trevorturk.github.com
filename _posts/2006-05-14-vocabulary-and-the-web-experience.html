I came across an article today that tied together something I've been thinking about for the last week or so. Although this article is short, it makes an excellent point. The copy on a site or in an application is probably just as important as the layout, colors, or features.

<blockquote>It's time we designers stop thinking of ourselves as merely pixel people, and start thinking of ourselves as the creators of experiences. And when it comes to experience on the web, there's no better way to create it than to write, and write well.

The <i>experience</i> of using a web application could be the most important part of the app. Let's take <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a> apps as an example. I noticed a while ago how the naming-scheme seems to be slanted toward outdoor imagery (Basecamp, Backpack, Campfire). I'm not sure how crucial having a good name is, and even the namer of Basecamp questions the importance:

<blockquote>A great name really helps. A good name isn't bad either. A bad name can probably hurt, but all in all I think names, logos, and taglines are vastly overrated. Give people a great product and they'll be happy. It does help if the name is short, unique, and memorable though -- it helps people spread the word.

...but there is <i>something</i> about a good name that helps with the overall packaging of an app. I don't know if you could quantify it, but I think there's got to some sort of subliminal effect of, say, outdoor imagery when you're staring at a computer screen. Think about it this way: why is the default Microsoft desktop wallpaper be a grassy field? If you look at the other pre-packaged wallpapers on XP you'll notice a theme there.
