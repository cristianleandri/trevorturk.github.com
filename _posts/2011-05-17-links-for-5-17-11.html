<p><a href="http://stuff-things.net/2011/05/16/legacy-development-with-pow/">Legacy Development with Pow « Stuff… And Things…</a></p>
<blockquote><p>However, there is a downside:  Pow doesn’t play nicely with Apache (or any server listening on port 80). Life isn’t all greenfield, if in the course of the day you need to work on PHP or CGI legacy apps Pow is not so simple.   Pow creates a firewall rule that redirects port 80 to its port; to access Apache you need to either toggle the firewall rule on and off or move Apache to a different port all together. And now you’re running two web servers.  There has to be a better way.

What we really wanted was a headless implementation of WebKit’s rendering engine that could be driven by Capybara tests. After Tristan “Websockets” Dunn showed me PhantomJs, I realized this might be possible using Qt’s WebKit implementation.

<blockquote><p>HireFire automatically "hires" and "fires" (aka "scales") Delayed Job (and soon Resque too!) workers on Heroku. When there are no queue jobs, HireFire will fire (shut down) all workers. If there are queued jobs, then it'll hire (spin up) workers. The amount of workers that get hired depends on the amount of queued jobs (the ratio can be configured by you). HireFire is great for both high, mid and low traffic applications. It can save you a lot of money by only hiring workers when there are pending jobs, and then firing them again once all the jobs have been processed. It's also capable to dramatically reducing processing time by automatically hiring more workers when the queue size increases.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Here's a talk I gave at Future of Web Apps 2010 in London. In this talk, I walk through the steps of creating a web app including modeling, sketching, HTML, Photoshop explorations, and moving from static mockups to live running code. Each step is illustrated with a real example, including some live sketching and live HTML. I also wanted to give a sense of how we think about apps at 37signals, as a stack of different levels that we can iterate on individually.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>If I ask you to visualize a software product, a picture of the interface probably comes to mind. From the user’s perspective, the interface is the product. For us on the development side, the product is more than that. It’s the interface, the code, the connections from code to UI, the separations of concerns and the boundaries between features.</p></blockquote>

It is designed to compliment web application development and enforce a strict separation of concerns between designer and developer. Using Serve allows the designer to work in a separate prototype project, while the developer can work on the actual application and utilize resources from the prototype as needed. This allows the designer to focus on presentation and flow, while the developer can focus on implementation.</p></blockquote>
