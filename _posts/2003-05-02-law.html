So I've been thinking about going to law school, and I thought I would start a new category for that subject - maybe to encourage me to write about it. I'm going with <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0113492">Judge Dredd</a> as the first entry here because I think the movie was <a href="http://movieweb.com/movie/judgedredd/">great</a>. So sue me. I am the law.
