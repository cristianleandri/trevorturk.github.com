I'm trying to save hard drive space, since I've got this super small (and fast?) SSD hard drive on the way. I noticed that I was using a TON of space to store totally worthless logs for my Rails apps. Now, I know I could set up proper log rotation, but I don't feel like going through the trouble for my local machine. 

Here's a quick tip I picked up <a href="http://marklunds.com/articles/one/410">here</a> that will set your logs to automatically rotate in the test and development environments. Just add the following line to these files:

<ul>
<li>config/development.rb</li>
<li>config/test.rb</li>
</ul>

<pre>config.logger = Logger.new(config.log_path, 2, 20.megabytes)</pre>

Make sure you've got these in your .gitignore file as well:

<pre>/log/*
*.log</pre>

That will keep your log files under control, but with plenty of room for digging in if need be.
