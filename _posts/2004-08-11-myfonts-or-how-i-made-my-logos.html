Go on ahead and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/">Find, try, buy and download fonts online : MyFonts.com</a>. That's how I got all the cool logos you see I've got rotating on this here site. First, I used the free previews they offer on MyFonts.com, and then I layed them on the same size transparent background in <a href="http://adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop</a>. After that, I used the <a href="http://automaticlabs.com/products/rotator">Image Rotator</a> provided by Automatic Labs to have them all rotate randomly. If you want to see all of the logos, you can check out the <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/images/logos/">logos directory</a> I've got going here.
