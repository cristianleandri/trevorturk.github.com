I've very pleased to welcome our good friend Tim to the Weekly Digest. I'm sure you'll enjoy his contributions. You can follow along with <a href="http://delicious.com/timothyoconnell">his delicious account</a>, if you're into that sort of thing. We've also managed to inspire another weekly collection of links that you may be interested in checking out. Nick will be posting <a href="http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/2008/11/23/link-digest-for-creatives-and-creators-11-23-08/">links for creatives and creators</a> over on his blog, <a href="http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/"> greyscalegorilla</a>. 

So, without further ado, please join me in welcoming Tim's links:

<p><a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap.com</a>
<blockquote>If you can stomach the idea of someone else storing your data on his computers and are running out of disc, tarsnap might be the solution for you. Basically, you set up your machine to dump your data to the remote site, it is encrypted and then snapshots are taken (presumably at the normal rsnapshot intervals) and you can get at them whenever you need the data. The key here is encryption: there are dozens of places to stick your data, but the fact that you dump via a secure tunnel and that the site's proprietor never has any access to your data makes this solution a viable one. If I wasn't an incurable tin-foil-hat about privacy, I would definitely consider tarsnap.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://pixelpipe.com/"> Pixelpipe - Free your media, upload and share anywhere </a>
<blockquote>Like a lot of G1 applications that are either overt ports of iPhone software or obviously inspired by iPhone software, this one is still coming together. The big idea here is that this is a Web 2.0 labor-saver that automatically dumps your G1 pictures into your Facebook, Myspace, etc. account: I wouldn't say it's fully automatic yet, but it's getting there. I tried to link it up to my picasa account on day one and, after some finagling, managed to get it working. Ideally, it would "just work" and you could download and set this up without your home/laptop computer on a moving train. And, as I say, Pixelpipe isn't quite there yet, but it's got potential.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://lab.drwicked.com/writeordie.html">Write or Die : Dr Wicked's Writing Lab </a>
<blockquote>This is a tool, designed with creatives in mind (i.e. not coders), to encourage copywriters to shake their tail-feathers. The basic idea is that you tell it how many words you want to write and how much time you want to allow yourself to write those words and then it gives /you/ a text input window and a ticking clock. As the clock runs down, the text you enter is deleted if you stop typing. This definitely works just like the essay writing portion of a standardized test: you don't waste too much time tangentializing during the pre-writing/brain-storming processes and when you get down to it, you eyes don't drift backward to check for continuity/grammar errors or typos.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://noodlr.net/">Noodle Soup Oracle </a>
<blockquote>The so-called "noodle soup oracle" was "created by Michele Humes and Joshua Sierles after a meal of shrimp roe noodles in miso, topped with spicy carnitas, shelled edamame and chopped scallions"; at the click of a button, it will randomly choose a noodle, two savory additional ingredients and a sauce. It is also capable of suggesting noodle dishes bereft of meat. Indispensible for anyone who enjoys a.) the consumption of noodles and b.) letting a little chaos into his life from time to time.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://clonezilla.org/">Clonezilla</a>
<blockquote>I haven't had a chance to play this in an actual production environment, but it seems like a dream come true to anyone who has had to deploy workstations based on a common image: basically, in clonezilla you get a F/OSS alternative to Acronis/Norton Ghost that works a lot better than ghost4unix and has a some nice, time-saving user-friendliness features.</blockquote>
