Now that we have that <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f74ba37f4e4175d5a1b31da59d161b0020b58e94">nice syntax</a> for tests in Rails, I'm happy just using the baked-in <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> stuff. Well... maybe I still need <a href="http://mocha.rubyforge.org/">Mocha</a>. But the other stuff like <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, <a href="http://chneukirchen.org/repos/testspec/README">test/spec</a>, and <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda">Shoulda</a>? Meh. The only thing missing from Test::Unit is an easy way to defer tests. That's important. I'd been dropping "flunk" in tests to note that they weren't implemented yet, but that can get confusing pretty quickly. 

Luckily, there's a quick and easy way to add "deferred" tests. Here's how:

<pre lang="ruby">
# test/test_helper.rb
class Test::Unit::TestCase

  def defer
    puts "nDeferred: #{caller[0]}"
  end

end

# test/functional/home_controller_test.rb
require 'test_helper'

class HomeControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase  
  test "should defer test" do
    defer; return;
  end    
end
</pre>

This would produce output like so...

<pre>
~/git/h8ter $ autotest
loading autotest/rails
/opt/local/bin/ruby -I.:lib:test -rtest/unit -e "%w[test/functional/home_controller_test.rb...
Loaded suite -e
Started
....................
Deferred: ./test/functional/home_controller_test.rb:6:in `test_should_defer_test'
............................................
Finished in 0.795139 seconds.

64 tests, 123 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
</pre>

I thought I'd seen a commit from <a href="http://www.koziarski.net/">Koz</a> that added a nice way to defer tests in Rails, but I can't seem to find it. Please post a comment if you know what I'm talking about. In the meantime, here we are with a quick and dirty solution for your enjoyment.
