<p>If you happen to have been using Wordpress as a CMS, as you happen to have been asked to provide all of the content on your WP-powered site in a single web page or Word Document, then I've got a plugin for you.</p>

<p>The plugin is pretty simple. It dumps the content of your Wordpress pages onto a single page. The bonus is that providing your client with a Word DOC version of your site is as easy as opening your the page dump in Word and clicking Save As Word Doc.</p>
