I've cleaned out <a href="https://github.com/trevorturk/following">my GitHub watched repos</a> quite a bit. My newsfeed just had way too much going on. Something needed to be done. Before cleaning things up, I decided to bookmark all of the repos I had been watching on <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:trevorturk/t:github/">pinboard:github</a>. If you're interested, have a browse through those links. There are some really great projects buried in there.

<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2152286">Hacker News | Google algorithm change launched</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this week Google launched an algorithmic change that will tend to rank scraper sites or sites with less original content lower. The net effect is that searchers are more likely to see the sites that wrote the original content. An example would be that stackoverflow.com will tend to rank higher than sites that just reuse stackoverflow.com's content. Note that the algorithmic change isn't specific to stackoverflow.com though.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://wetzler.me/dropbox-syncplicity/">Graham Wetzler: Why Dropbox Succeeded and Syncplicity Didn’t</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning/">A List Apart: Articles: Never Use a Warning When you Mean Undo</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, and the next time you see a warning used instead of undo, send the designer of the application/website a nice e-mail suggesting that they implement an “undo” feature instead. Send them a link to this article. Let’s see if we can’t change the way people design on the web—and in the process make everyone’s computing life more humane and less frustrating in one little way. Let the war on warnings begin!</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://pivotallabs.com/users/ledwards/blog/articles/1534-http-basic-authentication-and-devise">Newlee - HTTP Basic Authentication and Devise</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Say you're using Heroku to host a staging version of your app that uses Devise for authentication. You want to keep unwanted visitors out of your staging app, but your app only uses authentication for certain features. You want to block outsiders from accessing the app entirely. Since Heroku doesn't allow you whitelist IP addresses in your webserver config, you might want to try HTTP basic access authentication to provide top-level authentication. Doing this in Rails is pretty straightforward.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What I saw in Google’s WiFi´s effort were different “professors” running around with different ideas, trying to line up Google resources behind them only to rise and fall with unfinished projects.

<blockquote><p>So, a while ago I write a Ruby YUI Compressor Wrapper which is still available and works great (although it could use a newer jar file) as far as I know... [but] on a new project I'm working on *I just need a inline YUI compressor* and I dont give a damn about anything else like bundling, globbing or whatever.
