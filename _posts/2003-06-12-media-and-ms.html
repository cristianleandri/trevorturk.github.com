A good article about the future of digital media and how Microsoft is participating in that struggle. My comments? I can't imagine that digital media <i>can</i> can have archiving restricted forever. I don't know where I read it or saw it, but someone said "if you have access to all of the streaming media (movies, music, etc) that you could ever want - why would you try to archive it? That would be like taping radio-on-demand. <a title="Wired 11.07: Bill Gates, Entertainment God" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.07/40gates_pr.html">Wired 11.07: Bill Gates, Entertainment God</a>

This is how Whiting is showing movies these days. His projection room is evidence that Microsoft's digital media strategy goes beyond the small screen. The Guild 45th belongs to Landmark Theatres - an indie-centric chain that signed a deal with Microsoft in April to roll out Media 9 players in its theaters nationwide. Whiting's the first on board and couldn't be happier about it. He says Media 9 could decrease distribution costs and eventually eliminate the need for expensive film. At that point, he says, his theater can focus on what it does best. "This opens up a lot of small indie films," he says. "Do you know how many of the 48 films at Cannes last year got distribution? Eight. Now we can do a Best of Cannes run, a series of one-night showings - and offer the kinds of things we're good at running."
