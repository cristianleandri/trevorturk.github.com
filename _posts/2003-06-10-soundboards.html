Soundboards are programs or webpages that allow you to make those prank calls using celebrity voice clips. You probably heard one with Al Pachino or Arnold saying "I'm a cop you idiot". This site has a number of really good ones, including Office Space and Jack Black. You can use them without a download, too - <a title="ebaumsworld.com Celebrity Soundboards - Pranks - Online Games Flash Cartoons, Funny movies, funny pictures, Jokes, Prank phone calls and more" href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/soundboards.shtml">ebaumsworld.com Celebrity Soundboards</a>.
