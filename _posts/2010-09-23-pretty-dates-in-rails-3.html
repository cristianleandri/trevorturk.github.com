It's very easy to define your own custom date formats for display in a Rails 3 app. Just check out <a href="http://caboo.se/doc/classes/ActiveSupport/CoreExtensions/Time/Conversions.html#M005558">the docs</a>.

A quick example:

<pre>
# config/initializers/time_formats.rb
Time::DATE_FORMATS[:month_and_year] = "%B %Y"
Time::DATE_FORMATS[:pretty] = lambda { |time| time.strftime("%a, %b %e at %l:%M") + time.strftime("%p").downcase }
</pre>

Then, you can do:

<pre>
@date.to_s(:month_and_year) # => October 2010
@date.to_s(:pretty) # => Mon, Oct 4 at 7:00pm
</pre>

The "pretty" example is pretty tricky, actually. It's using some lesser known strftime conversions to show dates without leading zeros and downcasing the am/pm.
