I remember searching <i>all over the place</i> for some reasonable "activity indicators", which I could use in a web-application I was building. It was too late for that when I stumbled across this <a href="http://www.napyfab.com/ajax-indicators/">very nice collection</a>, but I'm sure it'll come in handy later. As an aside, I packaged the images up into this <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/almosteffortless/ajax-activity-indicators.zip">zip file</a>... just in case.
