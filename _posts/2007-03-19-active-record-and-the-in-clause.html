So here's the setup:

<pre lang="ruby">Site => Categories => Forums => Topics => Posts</pre>

That's a <a href="http://forums.punbb.org/">pretty standard</a> setup for a web-based forum, where Topics are in a particular Forum and those Forums are, in turn, organized by Category. Retrieving the Topics in a particular Forum is easy, since I have a "forum_id" column in my "topics" table:

<pre lang="ruby">@topics = Topic.find(:all, :conditions => ["forum_id = ?", @forum.id])</pre>

But what if I want to retrieve the Topics in a particular Category? That's not quite as easy, since there's no "category_id" column in my "topics" table. What to do? The "WHERE IN" clause is what you're supposed to use here, I think. That's when you make a query something like this:

<pre lang="ruby">@topics = Topic.find(:all, :conditions => ["forum_id in ?", @forums])</pre>

This might read something like "find all topics where the forum_id is in my @forums object". But (of course) that won't work. What to do? Hack together a string of forum_ids that's worthy of passing into this query? There's got to be a better way. 

When in doubt, I always turn to the fabulous open-source work of one <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olson</a>, because searching around the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">Rails API</a> or plain old <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> isn't nearly as informative as seeing real live code examples. And when it comes to really nice real live code examples, it doesn't get any better than <a href="http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/">techno-weenie</a>.

So, what's the solution?

<pre lang="ruby">@category = Category.find(params[:id])
@forums = Forum.find_all_by_category_id(@category.id)
@topics = Topic.find(:all, :conditions => ["forum_id in (?)", @forums.collect(&:id)])</pre>

Easy as pie.
