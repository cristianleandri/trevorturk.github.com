<a title="Apple Introduces Music Store, iTunes 4, new iPod" href="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/03/04/28/1723226.shtml?tid=188&tid=141&tid=176">Slashdot | Apple Introduces iTunes Music Store, iTunes 4, new iPod</a>. This is big news to me, because I think the music companies are finally understanding how to do music biz online - you have to sell the mp3s, not license them.
