<a href="http://www.stylegala.com/features/bulletmadness/">Bullet Madness - 200 Free Bullets Project at Stylegala</a><blockquote>Bullet madness is a list of 200 bullets, arrows and icons uploaded by our users. A handy collection of bullets for your webdesign needs - these icons can add that little extra to your design and make your site stand out from the crowd.</blockquote>

Quite the handy site - I come back often to use the icons for bullet points in various sites. You'd be surprised, but using something that the standard, default, <i>boring</i> bullet points can add a little <b>whiz-bang</b> to your otherwise plain design!
