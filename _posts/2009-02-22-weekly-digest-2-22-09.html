<blockquote>...the key is that it minimizes friction. There’s little friction to create a new note, and little friction to search for existing ones. And you never have to explicitly save anything.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>What went wrong? So many things. I could blame our market research or our promotional site, or our target demographic, but really it’s our fault. We weren’t in love with FamSpam – we never were. We thought it was a great idea, and maybe it was, but it was a great idea for our parents. For our families. For other people. Not for us. It wasn’t a site I would check every day. It wasn’t something my friends would use ever. I’m going to continue, but to me this is the most important point so far. The biggest failure. I wasn’t in love with the company I was trying to build.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>It was really SMS that inspired the further direction -- the particular constraint of 140 characters was kind of borrowed. You have a natural constraint with the couriers when you update your location or with IM when you update your status. But SMS allowed this other constraint, where most basic phones are limited to 160 characters before they split the messages. So in order to minimize the hassle and thinking around receiving a message, we wanted to make sure that we were not splitting any messages. So we took 20 characters for the user name, and left 140 for the content. That’s where it all came from.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>The problem with rating systems in general is that only people who feel very strongly about something will take the time to rate it. For a five star scale, that suggests mostly one and five star ratings.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>In this way, Poole's problem is the problem of the entire Internet, which is built on wireless connections and a lot of &quot;theoretically.&quot; It's where people spend time, make friends, play games, get news -- and yet despite all of that philosophical worth, the smartest minds in the country still struggle with how to make even the most successful sites profitable.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Google Quick Search Box is an open source search box that allows you to search data on your computer and across the web. This app is very experimental, but through it you will be able to see many of the areas we are exploring: contextual search, actions, and extensibility. It is by no means feature-complete, but is a very good indication of things to come.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>I’ve been researching CouchDB this week, and I’m getting more and more excited by it the more I learn. It combines data storage, REST-based APIs, scalability and data propagation through replication, and even application hosting. It’s actually a lot like Google’s internal infrastructure, but in an open and modular form.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">The Law of Leaky Abstractions</a>
<blockquote>The law of leaky abstractions means that whenever somebody comes up with a wizzy new code-generation tool that is supposed to make us all ever-so-efficient, you hear a lot of people saying &quot;learn how to do it manually first, then use the wizzy tool to save time.&quot; Code generation tools which pretend to abstract out something, like all abstractions, leak, and the only way to deal with the leaks competently is to learn about how the abstractions work and what they are abstracting. So the abstractions save us time working, but they don't save us time learning.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>To most sane people, the idea of keeping violent media out of the hands of impressionable children is as patently absurd as all other forms of censorship: the idea of raising children on strictly non-violent narratives means that you lose most of, if not all of the books that we regard (in the West, at least) as canonical. Bye-bye Iliad! Holler back, Star Wars: you will be missed. See-you-later, Old and New Testaments! This article from Ars describes the efforts of an author so dense that she actually feels the need to make the case _in favor_ of allowing children to consider violent media, lest they grow into extremely maladjusted adults who are utterly unprepared to make their way in a world in which violence is not only &quot;the supreme authority from which all other authority is derived&quot;, but also the implicit means and end of most pursuits in which they will find themselves engaged.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>On the one hand, it was kind of cheering to learn that some lowly MS coder hand-translated these URI strings into l337-sp34k . On the other hand, it was depressing to remember that people are actually using Sharepoint in their daily lives.</blockquote></p>
