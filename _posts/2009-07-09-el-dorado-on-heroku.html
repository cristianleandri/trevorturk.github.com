I'm pleased to announce that <a href="/eldorado">El Dorado</a> is now compatible with <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, the instant Ruby platform. 

<a href="http://heroku.com"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/almosteffortless/heroku.jpg" alt="heroku" title="heroku" width="185" height="73" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1536" /></a>

This means that deploying El Dorado is no longer a pain in the ass. It also means that you can get started with El Dorado <i>for free</i>. Just follow along with the installation and deployment instructions in the <a href="http://github.com/trevorturk/eldorado/tree/master">README</a> and you're good to go. 

If you need help along the way, drop by the support site: <a href="http://eldorado.heroku.com/">http://eldorado.heroku.com/</a>

Enjoy!
