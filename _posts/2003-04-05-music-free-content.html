I found this article to be very interesting: <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1071-995188.html?tag=fd_nc_1">News.com - Free Content</a>. It suggests that music should serve as free content for companies like Sony to push thier products. For example, Sony is rumored to earn more from player hardware than from its own music division. So maybe they want to provide some free music as an incentive to buy thier walkman? If anybody actually reads this, let me know what you think, ok?
