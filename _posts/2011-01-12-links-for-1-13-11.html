Let's celebrate the new year with the first round of links from my new account on <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:trevorturk">Pinboard</a>. I've decided to move away from <a href="http://www.delicious.com/trevorturk">Delicious</a> due to fear, uncertainty, and doubt that the service may be shutting down. See <a href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2848">Yahoo!locaust</a> for more information on that subject. 

I've been very happy with Pinboard so far, and would highly recommend it as an alternative to Delicious. They even have a handy Delicious->Pinboard importing feature to help get you started. It's much faster, more pleasing to the eye, and seems to be actively maintained by smart people. It's a win all around. 

This also means that I have a new way of getting at my links for publishing here. I whipped together a quick Rake task based on <a href="https://github.com/SingAlong/pinboard-ruby/blob/master/pinboard.rb">some code I found</a> while Googling around. It's nothing special, but it seems to get the job done:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/777224.js?file=Rakefile"></script>

...it works, you know?

So, this set of links includes a bunch of stuff I cleared out from <a href="https://github.com/trevorturk/following">my GitHub watch list</a>, which had gotten a bit overwhelming. I subscribe to my private GitHub RSS feed in Google Reader to help me keep up with the projects I'm interested in, and checking that on a weekly basis works well for me. Still, it was time to do a little spring cleaning... in the dead of winter... I suppose... :)

So, without further ado:

<p><a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/home.aspx">Campaign for Real Ale</a></p>
<blockquote><p>CAMRA campaigns for real ale, real pubs and consumer rights. We are an independent, voluntary organisation with over 100,000 members and have been described as the most successful consumer group in Europe. CAMRA promotes good-quality real ale and pubs, as well as acting as the consumer's champion in relation to the UK and European beer and drinks industry.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://hckrnews.com/about.html">hckr news - an unofficial, alternative Hacker News interface</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Hacker News is a great resource. However, I seemed to constantly run into two issues. 1. If I didn't visit at least once a day, top items would scroll off the top pages and I would never see them. 2. If I was procrastinating and visiting the page often, I would find it difficult to determine what was new on the page. That frustration led to hckr news, a chronologic list of items that have made it onto the Hacker News homepage.</p></blockquote>

Note that these are my definitions, they don't necessarily have to be officially named, they're solely based on my experiences.
