Well, I just placed my first ever item for sale on eBay. That's right. First ever. I know you're probably wondering how it is that a computer savvy guy (read: dork) like myself never sold anything on eBay before... But I don't have an answer to that. I just never did it. Perhaps I'll sell my old shortwave radio next! Who knows? So, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=4127210571">go bid</a> on my 60 gig hard drive. You'll be buying a piece of Internet History. An investment in my future.
