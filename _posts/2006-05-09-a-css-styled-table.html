<a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php/blog/comments/a_css_styled_table/">Veerle's blog | A CSS Styled Table</a><blockquote>Further to my article about the creation of a CSS calendar the thought crossed my mind to show you an example on how you can style a table using CSS. The data of tables can be boring so all the more reason that we need to attract attention to it and make it as pleasant to read as possible. Presentation and design with some basic accessibility rules in mind is the way to go.</blockquote>

You can also jump straight to the <a href="http://www.duoh.com/csstutorials/csstables/">finished product</a>, complete with CSS styling. Very nice.
