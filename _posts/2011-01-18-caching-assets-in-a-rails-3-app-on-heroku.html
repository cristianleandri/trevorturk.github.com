In Rails apps, you often have multiple css and javascript files. If you're using the "javascript_include_tag" and/or "stylesheet_link_tag" helpers, you can let Rails automatically package multiple files into a single file by using the ":cache => true" option. I'm sure you're already aware of this, but if not, you can <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper.html#method-i-stylesheet_link_tag">read more about it here</a>. 

A problem arises when trying to deploy an app using this technique to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> due to their <a href="http://docs.heroku.com/constraints#read-only-filesystem">read-only filesystem</a> constraint. If you're familiar with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">Yahoo's Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site</a> and related <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow tool</a>, you know that caching your assets is an important part of having a speedy site.

There are a lot of possible <a href="https://github.com/amasses/heroku_asset_packager">solutions</a> <a href="https://github.com/mgomes/heroku_asset_cacher">to</a> <a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/jammit">this</a> <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/asset-resource">problem</a> <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/liability">hanging</a> <a href="https://github.com/sbecker/asset_packager">around</a>, but none of them seemed 100% ideal for my situation. So, I asked if there is a preferred method of caching/packaging assets in a Rails 3 app on Heroku in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/heroku/OXeyMyoPEg8/discussion">Heroku Google Group</a>. Nothing much came up, so I did a bit of Googling and came across this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/983837/forcing-rails-to-create-asset-cache-files">Stack Overflow page</a> that pointed me in the right direction. 

I've written a couple of small rake tasks that have been working quite well for me. The first is the "rake deploy" task. So, now I use "rake deploy" instead of "git push heroku master" when I want to deploy to Heroku. This caches my assets, pushed to github, deploys to heroku, and notifies hoptoad about the deploy.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/778234.js?file=deploy.rake"></script>

But the "rake cache_assets" task is what we're really interested in here. This leverages the built-in functionality of Rails to cache your assets, so it works exactly as you'd expect. It'll create the "all.js" and "all.css" automatically, because I'm using the ":cache => true" option in my helpers. It'll commit those files (if they've been changed) and then when I set "config.action_controller.perform_caching = true" in my "config/environments/production.rb" file, my app will use the cached files automatically. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/778234.js?file=cache_assets.rake"></script>

This is a great first step, but there's still more that can be done. As Heroku's <a href="https://github.com/ddollar">David Dollar</a> pointed out in the Google Group, one could package these assets up and upload them to S3, using CloudFront as a CDN, and telling Rails to use that as your <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper.html">asset host</a>. <a href="http://trevorturk.com/2010/02/08/cloudfront-no-brainer-cdn-support-for-s3/">I've talked about CloudFront before</a>, and I've had nothing but positive experiences with it, so I might try this in the future (uploading to S3 with <a href="https://github.com/geemus/fog">fog</a>, of course). If you're interested in collaborating on this, please drop me a line.
