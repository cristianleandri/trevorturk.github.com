A long time ago, a group of designers began a somewhat officially endorsed endeavor to redesign the Wordpress administration interface. I remember reading something around the time this started getting publicity that was <a href="http://9rules.com/whitespace/design_critiques/mt_vs_wp_vs_txp_entry_page_design.php">rather harsh</a> in regard to the drab grey look of Wordpress at the time. So, the <a href="http://www.brokenkode.com/shuttle">Shuttle</a> project caught my attention. The progress of the project was brought to my attention today via <a href="http://photomatt.net/2006/05/15/shuttle/">Photomatt.net</a>. From the <a href="http://www.brokenkode.com/shuttle">Shuttle</a> info page:

<blockquote>The Shuttle is a complete beautification of the WordPress Administration Panel. The project has been in development since early 2005. These are the images we did on Photoshop, so there is no plugin for you to download, as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not been incorporated into the final release yet.</blockquote>

I'm pretty impressed with the work so far, and I'm looking forward to this making it into the core. Estimated arrival... my guess... by the end of the year.
