<a title="Gnutella News - Cd Baby reports on itunes meeting re: indy music." href="http://www.gnutellanews.com/article/6830">Gnutella News - Cd Baby reports on itunes meeting re: indy music</a> and says that indy record labels get the same deal as the big players. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? I'm not really sure, but it seems promising. I wonder if and when they will get around to offering a chance for anybody to upload thier own music (or maybe that would swamp the service) - it is possible that record labels could pop up as 'fronts' for artists without regular contracts, giving everybody access to the new sales channel.
