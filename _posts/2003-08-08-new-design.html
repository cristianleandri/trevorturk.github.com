As you can see, I've been working on the site design a bit. The front page is almost done, and done enough to put up, I think. I'll make sure everything from the old version is moved over, but this is the main idea. <br /><br />I used <a href="http://www.allaire.com">Allaire Homesite</a> for the coding, which is a step up from Notepad for sure. I don't know what I was thinking trying to do without an HTML editor. The general layout is from <a href="http://www.glish.com/css/7.asp">glish.com's css section</a> which is pretty good, me thinks. I know nothing validates as XHTML or whatever, but I'm working on it and making this look right on Internet Explorer and Mozilla is hard enough as it is. <br /><br />The little post icon by the weblog entries is based on <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired.com's</a> little icon. You can click that thing to comment on a post or to link directly to it. I'll be adding something eventually so you can see if someone commented on a post already. The menu on the right is based on the one at <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/taminglists/">A List Apart</a> and the nifty scroll-over effect with the word in the upper right is from <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html">Eric Meyer's page</a>. Clicking on the little different colored boxes allows you to change the background color of the page. The script to do it is also from <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/alternate/">A List Apart</a> and the color choices are straight from <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~tigert/new_stock_project/">the Ximian Palate</a>, which also has many nice icons. You can click the silver bar at the bottom for the default color. The badges at the bottom right are from <a href="www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2002/ 10/22/steal_these_buttons.html">Antipixel</a> although you probably already knew that. The larger graphics that are advocating Mozilla over Internet Explorer are from <a href="http://www.bryanbell.com/newsItems/viewDepartment$Badges">Brayn Bell</a>. I'm using Mozilla, and I think it is way better. Click on the Internet Explorer logo to find out more.<br /><br />Other than that, let me know if something doesn't work here or whatever. I'll be updating the rest of the site over time.
