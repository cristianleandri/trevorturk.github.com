So, I just published my first Rails 3 gem engine: <a href="https://github.com/trevorturk/delayed_job_admin">delayed_job_admin</a>. Thanks very much to <a href="https://github.com/josevalim">Jos√© Valim</a> for his wonderful <a href="http://plataformatec.com.br/crafting-rails-applications/">book</a> and for <a href="https://github.com/josevalim/enginex">enginex</a>, which made creating this gem a breeze. 

It's a very simple (you might even say "unfinished") admin interface for <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/delayed_job">Delayed::Job</a>. 

Here's a screenshot:

Right now, it only lets you view jobs in your work queue. If/when I have the need for more features, I'll definitely add them into the gem. However, if you find that you like this interface and wish it did a bit more, please don't hesitate to fork and the gem and send me a pull request!

Thanks to <a href="http://www.captainu.com/">CaptainU</a> for letting me open-source this little bit of code. If you're looking for a gig working with Ruby, look no further - I hear they're <a href="http://www.captainu.com/jobs">hiring now</a>. Drop them a line and maybe we can hack on something together soon :)
