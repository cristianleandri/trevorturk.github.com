<a href="http://hivelogic.com">Hivelogic</a> has a really great piece about what it is like <a href="http://hivelogic.com/312.html">to not have a job</a> - and to want/need one. I have a bit of experience with this thing, as I'm sure many college graduates do. I see it this way, either you get lucky, you look for a job for months upon months and enrol in a work-exchange program after working at an insurance company and move to a different country, or you go to grad school as soon as possible. 
<blockquote>
You have a single desire: find a good job or project as soon as possible.<br /><br />When you drink coffee in the morning, you do so because this will heighten your response time, making you a more desirable candidate or project member and taking you one step closer to finding a good job or project as soon as possible.<br /><br />When you consume food, you do so not to enjoy it, but rather because your physical body requires it to create the energy you need to talk to recruiters, potential employers, go on interviews, read and post to the job-boards, or perform the work which generates the money you need to pay bills.
