I am pleased to announce that I have a new job! I've been promoted at the National Extension College <a href="http://www.nec.ac.uk">(link)</a> from "Post Room Support" to "Senior Editor". I am really excited about this new job, since it will allow me to put something decent on my resume (C.V.) for this time period while I am on BUNAC <a href="http://www.bunac.org.uk">(link)</a>. Plus, I think it should be pretty interesting, and probably give me some new skills while taking advantage of the skills I've got... Here is the job description, straight from the folks who hired me:

Study Programmes are currently overhauling the Guide to Courses and associated promotional material.&nbsp; As part of this process we would like to review and update the product information available to students across different channels.

We would like the help of a senior editor to improve the product information on the web site and in the Course Information Sheets in particular.&nbsp; This would also involve selecting samples of course materials to make available as online previews.
The role would include:

<ul>
  <li>Evaluating current information structure and content, and recommending changes</li>
  <li>Re-writing and generating copy for all or most of our 100 + courses</li>
  <li>Checking, correcting and updating information including online content</li>
  <li>Liaising with product development</li>
  <li>Selecting course samples for online preview<br />
  </li>
</ul>

The ideal candidate will:

<ul>
  <li>Be patient and meticulous - there are around 100 courses to cover</li>
  <li>Have great editing skills</li>
  <li>Be a confident writer</li>
  <li>Be able to deal with different sources of information</li>
  <li>Be able to deal with different people within NEC for approvals and sign-off</li>
  <li>Prior knowledge of NEC products and experience of html are advantageous but not requirements.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
