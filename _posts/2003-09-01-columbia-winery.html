Well, I'm off to Seattle on the 10th of September to work at the <a href="http://columbiawinery.com/">Columbia Winery</a> for about 9 weeks. I'll be working ten hour days or something like that, but I think it should be fun. Let me know if you need me to hook you up with some wine discounts. I'm guessing I won't have much time to write stuff up on this weblog here for a while, but I'll do what I can, and I'll post up some pictures when I get the chance. Speaking of which, there are some new ones up from the Harley Fest that are worth taking a look at.
