An interesting aside to the <a href="http://www.eldred.cc">Eldred</a> legal stuff - the overzealous extension of copyright laws has real world implications, and there are ways to preserve rare books. <a title="Robots digitizing libraries / New technology helps turn books into images" href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/05/19/BU52555.DTL">Robots digitizing libraries / New technology helps turn books into images</a>.
<blockquote>
Inside the room, a Swiss-designed robot about the size of a sport utility vehicle was rapidly turning the pages of an old book and scanning the text. The machine can turn the pages of both small and large books as well as bound newspaper volumes, and it can scan at speeds of more than 1,000 pages an hour.Occasionally the robot will stumble, turning more than a single page. When that happens, the machine will pause briefly and send out a puff of compressed air to separate the sticking pages.
