They get out of the way and let you directly interact with the problem you are solving. Everyone’s tried to remove a screw without a screwdriver; a task quickly becomes impossible that otherwise would be trivial.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>I didn't bookmark this because I want a nap room at my office; I did it because of my crusade to adopt Spanish-style siestas.
