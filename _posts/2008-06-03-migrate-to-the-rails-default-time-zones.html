I was recently upgrading my open-source app, <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/eldorado">El Dorado</a>, up to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/6/1/rails-2-1-time-zones-dirty-caching-gem-dependencies-caching-etc">Rails 2.1</a> and decided to switch over to the default time zones provided by the Rails. I'm not sure where I picked up the time zone definitions I was using before, but they were things like "US/Central" as opposed to "Central Time (US & Canada)". 

Switching to the new time zone definitions provided by Rails means not having to rely on the <a href="http://tzinfo.rubyforge.org">TZInfo</a> gem, because a stripped-down version is now packaged with Rails 2.1. 

Here's the migration used to achieve this, which was made with some help from <a href="http://mad.ly/">Geoff Buesing</a> himself:

<pre lang="ruby">
# db/migrate/20080603023415_use_rails_new_default_time_zones.rb

class UseRailsNewDefaultTimeZones < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    @users = User.all
    @users.each do |user|
      user.time_zone = 'UTC' if user.time_zone.blank?
      tz = TZInfo::Timezone.get(user.time_zone) rescue TimeZone[user.time_zone] || TimeZone['UTC']
      time_zone = if tz.is_a?(TZInfo::Timezone)
        linked_timezone = tz.instance_variable_get('@linked_timezone')
        name = linked_timezone ? linked_timezone.name : tz.name
        TimeZone::MAPPING.index(name)
      else
        tz.name
      end
      user.update_attribute(:time_zone, time_zone) unless time_zone == user.time_zone
    end unless @users.empty?
  end

  def self.down
  end
end
</pre>

If you haven't played with <a href="http://mad.ly/2008/04/09/rails-21-time-zone-support-an-overview/">the new time zone stuff in Rails 2.1</a>, make sure to check it out. It makes dealing with time zones so easy, it's almost unbelievable. Thanks, Geoff!
