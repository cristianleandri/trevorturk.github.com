This is a guest post from <a href="http://demongin.org/">Timothy O'Connell</a>.

This blog is going to end with a question that I have been unable, after countless minutes of Googling, to answer satisfactorily. It will start, however, with some givens.

I already know that if you want to alter the default settings for all profiles that will be created by a given Firefox installation in the future, you add the line for the preference that you want to effect those profiles to the file <em>FIREFOX_ROOT/defaults/profile/prefs.js</em>. 
 
Similarly, I already also know that if you want to push a preference to all currently existing users on the machine, you add the line for that preference to <em>FIREFOX_ROOT/deftauls/pref/firefox.js</em>.
 
The caveat there, of course, is that if the user of the profile have already changed a preference in his personal prefs.js (i.e. the one in <em>HOMEDIR/.mozilla/firefox/RANDOMALPHANUMERICS.USERNAME/prefs.js</em>) and it conflicts with your preference in the (global) firefox.js, then you (the admin) are SOL, because the program will defer to the user's personal prefs.js file.
 
Which brings us to the question: is there a way (short of writing a script to parse individual user's personal prefs.js files and modify them as needed) to push a preference to all users of a given Firefox installation?

Full disclosure: I'm posing this question for two reasons. The first reason is that I'm sort of passive-aggressive with Firefox: ours is a very love-hate relationship. The second reason is that I honestly don't think that what I'm describing--i.e. adding a preference to one, "master" preferences file that effects all users of a given installation, regardless of their personal prefs.js file--can be done.
 
Am I missing something? Maybe even something truly forehead-slap-worthy that's at the top of all the documentation? Or is this a real limitation of the program?
