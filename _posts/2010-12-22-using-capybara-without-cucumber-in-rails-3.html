I've been enjoying using <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> in a recent project, but I think it's mainly because I enjoy integration testing and working with <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a>. So, I wondered if it was possible to use Capybara in Rails 3. It turns out it's quite simple.

While <a href="http://techiferous.com/2010/04/using-capybara-in-rails-3/">this article</a> is helpful, it's a bit long and has some critical info buried in the comments. 

I'll cover the subject in brief here:
