<a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/index.htm">Floatutorial: Step by step CSS float tutorial</a> not only has a good tutorial on floats, but also a nuber of other useful things. List-a-matic is cool. Oh, and while you're at it, you should look at <a href="http://www.inknoise.com/experimental/layoutomatic.php">Layout-o-Matic</a>, which is pretty awesome. CSS is good.
