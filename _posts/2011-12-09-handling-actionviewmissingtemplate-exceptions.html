Perhaps you've been receiving annoying emails about exceptions like this in your Rails apps:

<pre><code>A ActionView::MissingTemplate occurred in posts#destroy:

Missing template posts/destroy with {:formats=>[:html], :locale=>[:en, :en], :handlers=>[:rjs, :rhtml, :rxml, :erb, :builder]} in view paths...</code></pre>

This exception is raised when you're missing the template for responding to a request of a certain format. So, if the browser requested HTML and you only expected to receive JS, you might simply modify your controller action like so:

<pre><code>respond_to do |format|
  format.js
end</code></pre>

This specifies that you're only going to respond to JS requests, and any others will be served a 406 "not_acceptable" response, which will quiet down that exception noise. 

Have you handled these in some other way? If so, please let me know!
