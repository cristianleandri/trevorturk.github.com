<blockquote>Controller responders handle the chore of matching the HTTP request method and the resource format type to determine what type of response should be sent. And since REST is so well-defined it’s very easy to establish a default responder to handle the basics.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/magazine/02cooking-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print">Out of the Kitchen, Onto the Couch</a>
<blockquote>“Here’s an analogy,” Balzer said. “A hundred years ago, chicken for dinner meant going out and catching, killing, plucking and gutting a chicken. Do you know anybody who still does that? It would be considered crazy! Well, that’s exactly how cooking will seem to your grandchildren: something people used to do when they had no other choice. Get over it.”</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/blog/?p=333">Approaching a Minimum Viable Product</a>
<blockquote>The purpose of the MVP is to answer your most pressing question, to validate your most pressing business assumption.

<blockquote>REST is a first-class citizen in the Rails world, though most of the hard work is done at the routing level. The controller stack has some niceties revolving around mime type handling with the respond_to facility but, to date, there’s not been a lot built into actionpack to handle the serving of resources.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/blog/470-deployment-script-spring-cleaning">Deployment Script Spring Cleaning at GitHub</a>
<blockquote>As we get ready to upgrade our servers I thought it’d be a good time to upgrade our deployment process. Currently pushing out a new version of GitHub takes upwards of 15 minutes. Ouch. My goal: one minute deploys (excluding server restart time).</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>QuickMagick is a gem for easily accessing ImageMagick command line tools from Ruby programs.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/08/01/rss-subscribers-or-twitter-followers-which-are-worth-more/">RSS Subscribers or Twitter Followers: Which Are Worth More?</a>
<blockquote>I would need to test first to find the optimal valuation, but I am guessing it would be between 5 and 10 Twitter followers for each RSS subscriber.</blockquote></p>

It’s tempting to think that adding a feature like this is just about adding the functionality — but there’s a bunch more to it than that.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>As Tom Peters says, "You can't shrink your way to greatness," and yet that's what so many dying businesses try to do. They hunker down and wait for things to get better, but they don't. This isn't a dip, it's a cul de sac. It's over.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Newsstand and subscription prices have never been the main source of revenue for newspapers anyway — advertising is.

Pre-Internet, newspapers had inordinate control over the supply of news, and therefore over the supply of advertising, and they grew fat on the profits.</blockquote></p>
