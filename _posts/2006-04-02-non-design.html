I couldn't agree more with <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/009000.php">ADTD</a>. 

<blockquote>I'm tired of this nonsense that suggests a "non-designed" site will be more successful because people are sensitive to using applications that aren't under the thumb of the man... Damn! I've struck gold! Quit your day job people, it doesn't matter if you have a good idea, it just doesn't matter. Go into Microsoft Frontpage and select Build > Community > Non-Designed > Ugly > Cash Cow and just wait for someone to offer hundreds-of-millions to buy you out.</blockquote>
