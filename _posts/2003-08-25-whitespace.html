<a title="Design Matters: White space" href="http://www.sheriftariq.org/design/whitespace/index.html">Design Matters: White space</a> is one of a couple nice articles about designing, but mostly about designing websites. Its not technical and worth a look, me thinks:
<blockquote>
Why is white space so important? Part of the reason is pshychological, and part of it is physical: the text needs room to breathe. When text crowds all the way to the edge, it leaves us feeling crowded and cramped. Long passages of text, written edge to edge can actually tire the eyes.
