There is a conversation going around regarding the warranties that you assert when licensing stuff under the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons License</a>, which is becoming increasingly popular. The thing is, I'm new to the law in this area - but I get the impression that the debate is somewhat understandable. As it stands, when you license something under the CC license, you are asserting that you grant permission for others to use it under whatever terms the CC license states. You are also providing some assurance that you have the authority to do so. Did that make sense?

I think what some people want is a license from CC that says only - I won't complain if you follow this license, but I can't say whether or not anybody else will. It seems to me that the purpose of the CC licenses is better served with the way they work now, and shouldn't be changed. Maybe made clearer, but not changed in meaning. If you have any thoughts, maybe you can read more at the Creative Commons Weblog: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3681">On Warranties</a>.
