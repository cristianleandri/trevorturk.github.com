I just finished reading this book called <i>Gig : Americans Talk About Their Jobs</i> and I highly recommend it. Its full of interesting and brief transcripts from interviews of all kinds of people who work in America today. They have a Walmart greeter, a UPS driver, a supermodel, a mother, a funeral home director, a doctor, a lawyer... Really, for somebody like me that is looking for something to do - some guidance in looking for work and a better idea of the current job landscape, or whatever - this was really fun to read. Yup. I would go on and on about it, but i'll stop here. ISBN: 0609807072
