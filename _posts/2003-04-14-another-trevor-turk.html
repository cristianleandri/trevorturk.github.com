Never before have I seen or heard of another "Trevor Turk" but today I stumbled across one! I was thinking about emailing him, but I'm sort of scared. I guess he is some sort of computer network guy who lives in Norfolk, you can see the page <a href="http://www.iagnorfolk.co.uk/local_contacts.php">here</a>. It's so creepy to see that name and know that it isn't me...<br /><br />

<b>Update:</b> Someone here at the NEC informed me that there are <a href="http://www.yournotme.com">actually</a> 4 other "trevor turks" in the UK alone (and that's only those who are over 18, registered to vote, and not in prison) !!!
