<blockquote>The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I didn't know wasn't merely vast; it was, for all practical purposes, infinite.

<blockquote>Now that we know the difference between an instance method and a class method, let’s cover the difference between include and extend in regards to modules. Include is for adding methods to an instance of a class and extend is for adding class methods. Let’s take a look at a small example.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Class methods can only be called on classes and instance methods can only be called on an instance of a class. It’s simple when you understand it, but I remember being confused when I was learning Ruby. Hope this helps. If I was unclear or incorrect at any point above, let me know. [Nice, easy to follow overview.]</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://hostingfu.com/article/server-monitoring-cacti-serverstats">Server Monitoring with Cacti + ServerStats | HostingFu</a>
<blockquote>This is kind of cool: if you've got a computer somewhere on your local network and you want the laity to have access to rough stats, all you've got to do is fire this package up, tweak xinetd a little bit, and voila--your boss can look over your shoulder from the comforts of his own office.</blockquote></p>

It's a neat little app--very minimalist and very Linux-y--that lets you check on your bandwidth, slice stats (e.g. mem/proc/distro name and version) and gives you the option to do a remote /sbin/poweroff or an /sbin/shutdown -h now. Very neat.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://threatpost.com/blogs/research-password-secret-question-woefully-insecure">Research: Password 'secret question' woefully insecure</a>
<blockquote>Let's get a movement going here: if enough Internet types spread the word that no one in their right mind or who possesses any kind of meaningful credential endorses "secret questions" and that, in fact, the research shows that they make accounts _less_ secure, maybe we can kick up enough dust to get rid of them.</blockquote></p>
