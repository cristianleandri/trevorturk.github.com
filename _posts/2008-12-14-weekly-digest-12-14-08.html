Here's the latest installment of super sweet links from yours truly, Trevor and Tim. Also, don't forget about our good friend Nick, who is <a href="http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/2008/12/07/link-digest-12-7-2008-in-3d/">also doing a weekly link digest</a> over on his blog.

<blockquote>A version of this code is in production use at Twitter and is one part of the reason Twitter’s uptime has improved so much over the last several months. This is real, pragmatic, unmagical, production-ready code that can be a big part of your Rails scaling strategy. It is designed with massive datasets and real-world operational challenges in mind. And it’s almost effortless to use, since it requires no changes to how you use ActiveRecord.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://picdit.wordpress.com/2008/12/14/mcdonald’s-new-packaging/">McDonald’s New Packaging</a>
<blockquote>The new packaging takes on another major area of criticism - the content of its food. So, for example, in the new design the box for a Big Mac is adorned with clean photographs of the fresh ingredients inside - a mound of ‘100% pure beef’ sits atop scales. There’s a real onion and a real lettuce. This is packaging as advertising in a very explicit form, campaigning heavily to convince the customer that this stuff is made from real things.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>After that moment of conception, what it is, however nascent, however raw, becomes part of the process. You’re adding to it. Changing it. Removing parts of it. But there is an it, where before there was not. There’s something magic and magnificent and frightening about that part in the creative process before there is an it, when you decide just what it should be.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>The first thing you’ll notice about 2.7 is its new interface. From the top down, we’ve listened to your feedback and thought deeply about the design and the result is a WordPress that’s just plain faster. Nearly every task you do on your blog will take fewer clicks and be faster in 2.7 than it did in a previous version.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Good product leaders have the vision and balls to be bold with experimentation, and equally bold with cutting all but the very best features and functions. A mature product is a phoenix which has burned to the ground and reformed hundreds of times. Each time it grows a bit closer to being the ideal solution to a real problem that users need solved.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>To Ozzie, software's soul does not lie in the accumulation of features. Instead, it lies in his dream of connectivity. &quot;Live Mesh is very Ray,&quot; Mitch Kapor says. &quot;It's the son of Groove, which is the son of Notes.&quot; Which was, of course, the son of Ozzie's beloved Plato. Thirty-three years later, Ozzie is still trying to build on what he saw in sophomore year. But it's no longer the Ray Ozzie vision. It's Microsoft's.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.yumsugar.com/2586902">Should Coffeehouses Do Something About Drink Loopholes? | coffee ...</a>
<blockquote>This article about Starbucks &quot;loopholes&quot; is exactly the type of knowledge that does /not/ need to be spread so far and so wide that it makes it back to Corporate. If, for example, the cornflower blue crew realizes that you can get a grande Americano (two shots) for under $3.00 at most locations while those two shots by themselves cost $4.00 or more, then those of us who occasionally have to drink Starbucks (on account of not acting like the pinkos we secretly are whenever the client wants to dip out of the office to speak candidly or the vendor wants to meet up in a totally neutral location bereft of anything that might cause anything to think even for a moment about anything other than the business at hand) will have no way to do so without dropping an unacceptable amount of paper on the worst McCoffee-house in the game. Basically, these hacks/exploits/whatever need to stay unexposed.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Full disclosure: I don't put any dairy in my coffee (seriously--why even drink coffee? if creaminess is what you're after, may I recommend chocolate milk? seriously: you should try it) and I'm too old and poor to fuck around with lattes anymore (except on special occasions). That said, what you've got here is a nice summary of sweetener options: you've got mentions of setiva and turbinado and a quick nod in the direction of nutrition mythology (if you're into that sort of thing). Mostly valuable as a primer on sweeteners.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>This is probably the best get-fly-off-the-handle-mad-about-prop-8 blog post. I've added it to my del queue because it seems like it's going to be the genre-closer: it's short and it goes back and forth between cloyingly maudlin (complete with developmental disabilities and child abuse) and threateningly vituperative in a way that I think represents the spectrum of acceptable responses to the passage of the proposition.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ricksteves.com/graffiti/bestof_scams05.htm">Graffiti Wall Distillation: Tourist Scams, 2005</a>
<blockquote>I generally wouldn't ever recommend a list of common tourist scams to anyone who wasn't my mother; it's patronizing and, basically, if you're an adult and you haven't got the wherewithal to seek out this information on your own before doing your recreational thrill-seeking in the tourist traps of the First and Third worlds, then you deserve whatever happens to you. I would, however, recommend a list of common tourist scams to aspiring writers, creative and otherwise. Such a list as this one is exactly the kind of invaluable resource to which writing teachers and professional novelists often refer as their &quot;secret weapons&quot;. Very interesting and inspiring stuff.</blockquote></p>
