<p>I haven't bothered to upgrade my Wordpress installation away from the 2.0.x series yet, primarily because <a href="http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/">Mark Jaquith</a> & Co. have <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/02/new-releases/">committed to providing security updates</a> to the 2.0 line through 2010. However, <a href="http://geheimwerk.de/">Jan</a> and <a href="http://www.gunnart.de/">Gunnar</a> were nice enough to update my <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/wordpress/mass-edit-pages/">Mass Edit Pages</a> plugin to work with Wordpress versions 2.1.x and the new 2.2 series.</p>

<p>While they were at it, they made the plugin I18n compatible, which is great for people who don't speak English. They even included a version that comes with the full German translation. Thanks, guys!</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Gunnar provided a small update for the 2.1.x version of this plugin today, which fixes a problem that occasionally popped up involving updating the Wordpress cache.</p>
