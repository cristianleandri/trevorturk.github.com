When I came back to using WordPress recently, I was disappointed by the overwhelming complexity of the themes in the Theme Directory. I wanted to build something for my own site, but I was having trouble finding a reasonable base that I could build upon.

What's the bare minimum necessary to make a fully functioning theme for WordPress 3.0.1? The answer wasn't clear.

So, I set out to make the simplest possible theme for WordPress that would be approved for the Theme Directory. After a few revisions with the helpful guidance of the theme reviewers, it's available now:

<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplest"><img src="http://wp-themes.com/wp-content/themes/simplest/screenshot.png" style="border:1px solid #ddd;"></a>

<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplest">http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/simplest</a>

The theme is good enough to use as-is, in my opinion, but it's first and foremost an example of the simplest possible theme that you can make for WordPress version 3.0.1. This makes is a a great candidate for do-it-yourself folks like me who want to make their own themes, but would like some basic level of support to build upon.

Here's the code in case you're curious:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/588028.js"> </script>

It's 83 lines of PHP and 75 lines of CSS in 4 files.

That's an extraordinarily small amount of code for a fully functional WordPress 3.0.1 theme. To put it into perspective, the current default theme "<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyten">TwentyTen</a>" clocks in at 1551 lines of PHP and 1951 lines of CSS in 24 files. Of course, they're not making an effort to be succinct, but with a functions.php file that's 483 lines of code alone, I find it to be rather confusing to navigate.

So, I put something together that is truly minimal. Not only minimal in design, but has a minimal amount of clear, readable, understandable code. I hope you find it useful!
