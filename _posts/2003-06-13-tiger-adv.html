An article titled <a title="Eye on the Tiger for clothing trends" href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/usopen/cst-spt-tiger12.html">Eye on the Tiger for clothing trends</a> makes it clear that paying athletes big money to wear clothes is probably quite effective. 
<blockquote>
When Tiger Woods wakes up this morning, he will not have to think twice about his outfit. It was picked out for him a year and a half ago, just like the clothes he will be wearing Friday through Sunday at the U.S. Open at Olympia Fields.
<br /><br />
It is all part of the marketing strategy for Nike Golf, which scripts Woods' clothes for the majors and then ships the merchandise to stores around the country a couple weeks after each major. Woods' popularity and the television exposure generated by the tournaments combine to increase sales of the selected items.
