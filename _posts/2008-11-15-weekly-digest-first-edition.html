This is the first of what I hope will become a regular feature around here; a weekly digest of interesting links. Since this is the first edition, I've gone back into the archives a bit and pulled out some of my favorites from the last month or so. 

As a bonus, I thought I'd share the simple little Ruby script I'm using to pull this thing together with the quickness. It's using the fantastic <a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/tree/master">httparty</a> from <a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker">John Nunemaker</a>. If you save that as <i>delicious.rb</i> and run it (perhaps via command-R in TextMate), you'll get ready-made output for your blog.

<pre lang="ruby">
# http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/
require 'rubygems'
require 'httparty'

config = YAML::load(File.read(File.join(ENV['HOME'], '.delicious')))
# For this to work, simply put a .delicious file in your home directory that looks like this:
# username: example
# password: whatever

class Delicious
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'https://api.del.icio.us/v1'
  
  def initialize(u, p)
    @auth = {:username => u, :password => p}
  end

  def recent(options={})
    options.merge!({:basic_auth => @auth})
    self.class.get('/posts/recent', options)
  end
end

delicious = Delicious.new(config['username'], config['password'])
links = delicious.recent(:query => {:count => '100'})['posts']['post']

links.each do |l|
  puts "<a href="#{l['href']}">#{l['description']}</a>"
  puts "#{l['extended']}"
end
</pre>

If you're interested in getting a steady stream of links, you can subscribe to <a href="http://delicious.com/trevorturk">my delicious feed</a>. 

A trick that I've recently picked up is adding people to <a href="http://delicious.com/network/trevorturk">my network</a> and then subscribing to my network's feed. This way, I have a nice collection of links all bundled together from people I'm interested in. The delicious network is a highly underrated tool, in my opinion. Perhaps its value just isn't obvious enough. It's not really promoted well, but if you think about it, the delicious network is basically a twitter for links. I feel like you could rebrand it, get some VC money, and TechCrunch would eat it up :)

Anyway, here's the first (extra large) installment of links for your enjoyment:
