Just a quick entry, but I thought this was great: <a href="http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/001049.shtml">Old School Mowing</a> as in lawn mowing. It's just that I was thinking about this a month ago or so when I was mowing a large lawn at my family friends' place in Wales. Why use the gas mowers if you can do it just as easy with one of the old-fashioned lawn mowers?
