I must say that, although very happy working on an Apple computer for about 2 years now, the closed and proprietary nature of Apple products continues to irk me. I think <i>the system</i> (the hardware/software combo) is solid, but it bugs me that you've got to buy into the system the whole way. It's an all-or-nothing type of situation, and the lock-in is pretty obvious. If you feel the same way, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/16/juggling-oranges">Juggling oranges</a> (written by a longtime Apple advocate turned hater, who was prompted by <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/06/and_oranges">this article</a>) is going to tickle your fancy:

<blockquote>...you can begin to see why I chose to switch away from Apple and onto a Free Software platform.  Mac OS X is only available from Apple, and it only runs on Apple hardware.  Running a Free Software operating system removes both of these risk factors at once.  Furthermore, Apple has made it very clear that they will do everything in their power to protect this lock-in.  Despite the fact that their Intel-based operating system could run on commodity hardware, Apple has intentionally crippled Mac OS X with code that checks the hardware to ensure that it came from Apple.  They're intentionally introducing friction between the layers, bolting their operating system onto their hardware.  Some day there will be no hardware that can run Mac OS X, and because of Apple's DRM it will be illegal to emulate it in software.</blockquote>

As of late, I've been doing my best to avoid falling into (what I call) the <i>good-guy-bad-guy</i> logical fallacy - where one feels the need to pick sides between two things, such as competing technology companies. This is an easy thing to slip into, and can be evidenced in many "switchers" that have a bad experience with, say, Microsoft, and decide to say, switch to Apple products.

The temptation is to buy into the whole marketing image of the products that you drop your hard-earned money on, while eschewing what you had used formerly. In this case, one might be tempted to adopt an almost religious fanaticism to, say, Apple, while droning on and on about the inferiorities of Apple's competitors. This is commonly referred to as becoming a <i>fan-boy</i>.

The best attitude to have in this sort of situation, in my opinion, is a healthy skepticism toward organizations that are interested in selling things to you. If you can keep your emotional bonds to electronic goods and the people that peddle them, I think it's for the best.
