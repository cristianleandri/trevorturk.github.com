This <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/vistab2.ars/1">tour of Windows Vista Beta 2</a> is quite exciting, even for a fairly-new Mac fanboy like myself. Worthy of note are the improvements to "alt-tab" (now known as Windows-Flip), which seems to be on the right track *<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/&e=9797">cough</a>*. My biggest gripe in using Windows nowadays is the lack of mouse support on alt-tab, which I hope will be included here.

Also of interest are Windows Media Center's new support of image/photo handling. However, the thing I'm most excited about is the new Windows Calendar, featuring apparent use of the iCalendar format. Microsoft's support of an open and non-propritary format is a very good thing, indeed. Not to be overlooked is the new UAC (User Account Controls) feature, which ought to provide some much-needed relief from malware, viruses, and other security woes.

But perhaps you're looking to hate? Look no further: <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9000829&source=NLT_PM&nlid=8">20 Things</a><a> to hate about Vista.</a>
