<blockquote>
Designing With Web Standards is for every web professional who wants to reach more users on more browsers, platforms, and devices including wireless and hand-held devices with less work, less maintenance, and at lower cost. It's for designers, developers, site owners and managers who seek to end the costly spiral of obsolescence, where each new browser or Internet device means a whole new coding cycle and another line item on the budget. Few organizations today can afford the merry-go-round of coding and re-coding that has characterized web development until now.
