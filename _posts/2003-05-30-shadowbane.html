This is just funny - Hackers got into an online game and ruined it - <a title="Hackers Put 'Bane' in Shadowbane" href="http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,59034,00.html"> Hackers Put 'Bane' in Shadowbane</a>

<blockquote>
The population of an entire Shadowbane town was forcibly moved to the bottom of the sea, where they drowned. City guards turned feral and attacked town residents. Mobs of never-before-seen superpowerful creatures, seemingly spontaneously spawned from the ether, began to prowl the streets unchecked, killing characters in the most painful way possible.
