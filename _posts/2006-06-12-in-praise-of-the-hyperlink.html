<a href="http://adactio.com/articles/1132/">In Praise of the Hyperlink</a> is a really excellent and well deserved ode to the fundamental building block that serves as the foundation for the Internet &mdash; <i>a</i>: <blockquote>...Remember the realisation that you were interacting with something that was potentially neverending; a borderless labyrinth of information, all interconnected through the beautiful simplicity of the hyperlink. We may have grown accustomed to this miracle but that doesn't make it any less wondrous.

We are storytellers, no longer huddled around separate campfires, we now sit around a virtual hearth where we are warmed by the interweaving tales told by our brothers and sisters. Everyone is connected to everyone else by just six degrees of separation. Thanks to the hyperlink, we can find those connections and make them tangible.

The dream of hypertext has become a reality.</blockquote>
