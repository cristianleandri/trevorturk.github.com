<p>I just pushed a small collection of packages for <a href="http://github.com/crafterm/sprinkle">Sprinkle</a> up to Github:</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/trevorturk/sprinkle-packages">http://github.com/trevorturk/sprinkle-packages</a></p>

<p>I want to give a big thanks to <a href="http://timelines.com">Timelines, Inc.</a> for sponsoring the development of these packages.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://timelines.com">http://timelines.com</a> if you're interested in historical events and what happened on this week in history.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/crafterm/sprinkle">Sprinkle</a> is a software provisioning tool you can use to build remote servers. It's kind of like a simple version of <a href="http://github.com/opscode/chef">Chef</a>, I think.</p>

<p>Some of these examples packages include ones for nginx with Passenger, Ruby Enterprise, Monit, memcached, Capistrano, Varnish, etc.</p>

<p>I don't really intend to update these packages, nor do I think they're entirely complete or exactly right for your needs. I've pulled them out of existing Sprinkle stacks, so they probably won't even run as-is. Still, they may serve as a useful starting point for someone.... they've definitely been handy for me.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
