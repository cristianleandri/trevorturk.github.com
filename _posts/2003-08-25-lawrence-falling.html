For anybody else who went to Lawrence University in Appleton, WI - there is some bad news over here <a title="usnews.com: America's Best Colleges 2004: Liberal Arts Colleges-Bachelor's (Nationally) Top Schools" href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/libartco/tier1/t1libartco_brief.php">usnews.com: America's Best Colleges 2004: Liberal Arts Colleges-Bachelor's (Nationally) Top Schools</a>. It looks like we've fallen down to 51. Luckily, however, they group the top 100 in the same list now, so it doesn't look too bad and I guess we can still say we are "top tier"... I guess.
