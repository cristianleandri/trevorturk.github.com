I picked this book up over the weekend, and I pretty much read all of it. I was looking for a book that would help me out in learning CSS, as I had been looking through who knows how many webpages to patch together enough knowledge to get started. However, I think that the price of this book ($30) was worth it for all the trouble it saved in getting half-decent information from all over the place. Even though the sections all seem short, they really get right to the point and tell you everything you need to know about that particular topic.

Just reading the section on CSS would have saved me hours of hunting and gathering on the internet, and made my web design process much much easier. I highly recommend it for people who are interested in learning web design. It will save you hours and give you more accurate information. But this book was also good for me - someone looking to learn a new skill (CSS) or to have a desktop reference. If you want more information, check out the official page at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wdnut2/">O'Reilly</a>.
