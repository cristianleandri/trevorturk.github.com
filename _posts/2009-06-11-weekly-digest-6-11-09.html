<p><a href="http://blog.linkibol.com/post/How-to-Build-a-Popularity-Algorithm-You-can-be-Proud-of.aspx">How to Build a Popularity Algorithm You can be Proud of</a>

<blockquote>Anyway, I'm bored on a long bus drive and there's no real moral to the story here, just writing. I will be tuning out of the social networking sites because at the end of the day it's now doing more harm than good in the bigger picture and the experiment seems to have yielded a result.

<p><a href="http://jamesgolick.com/2009/6/4/introducing-trample-a-better-load-simulator.html">Introducing Trample: A Better Load Simulator</a>
<blockquote>Most load sim tools make requests to a static list of urls. They spawn n threads and make requests to the urls on the list in succession, in each thread. Unfortunately, though, if your applicaition makes use of any kind of caching (including your database's internal caching facilities), this kind of load simulation is unrealistic.</blockquote></p>
