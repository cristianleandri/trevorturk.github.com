Here's a little trick you can use to dynamically create remote forms with very little effort. This particular example shows how to create checkboxes that, when clicked, will submit the form and update the record in the database all without leaving the page. 

First, we'll create the form anywhere in our app:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/548387.js?file=index.html.erb"></script>

Note the <i>remote => true</i> form option and <i>submittable</i> css class. 

In order to accept the form, we'll need to create the corresponding controller action:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/548387.js?file=tickets_controller.rb"></script>

Then, we'll use a little bit of jQuery that tells the browser to submit the form if any element with the class <i>submittable</i> is changed:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/548387.js?file=application.js"></script>

Finally, we may want to perform some action after the form is submitted:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/548387.js?file=update.js.erb"></script>

This is just a quick little example, but you can imagine how the technique could be applied to a lot of different things. Rails 3 and jQuery make it really, really easy to submit forms on the fly without reloading the page or even having the user click <i>submit</i>.
