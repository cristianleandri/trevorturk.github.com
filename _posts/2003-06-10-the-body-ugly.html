<a title="The Body Ugly: Signal vs. Noise Weblog / Blog (by 37signals)" href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000200.php?59">The Body Ugly: Signal vs. Noise Weblog / Blog (by 37signals)</a> is an interesting weblog post that got my attention. The rest of the post and comments that follow aren't great (or good) but this little passage really caught me:

<blockquote>
We spend a lot of time figuring out how things function. What are the best solutions? How does one thing interact with another? What methodologies and processes make the most sense? How can I get the optimum out of my job, my time, my life? We optimize everything and constantly strive for perfection.But when it comes to the amazing vehicle inwhich we are able to exist in this world, we don't give a shit. We throw processed crap, alcohol, antibiotics, chemicals and harmful, unknown substances into it without thinking. We don't give it enough fruits, vegetables, vitamins & minerals or excersize. We even deprive it of water - it's life substance. We treat our computers and cars better than we treat our bodies and the payback is a hard blow when it comes.
