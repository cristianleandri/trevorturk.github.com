<a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip">Paperclip</a> is a great way to allow file uploads in your Rails application. However, it doesn't give you much in the way of tools to move those files around once they're on the server, so I concocted a little strategy for doing so. 

I <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/paperclip-plugin/browse_thread/thread/9460471066985201">tried</a> to get this into Paperclip itself, but it looks like I'm the only person who actually needed it, but I'm hoping this blog post will come in handy for someone eventually. 

If you have a User model with an avatar attachment, you'd need the following:

<pre lang="ruby">
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_attached_file :avatar # etc...

  def avatars 
    versions = self.avatar.styles.keys << :original
    versions.map do |version|
      {:path => self.avatar.path(version), :url => self.avatar.url(version)}
    end
  end

end
</pre>

This would give you an array to access the path and url for each avatar like so:

<pre lang="ruby">
User.last.avatars.each do |avatar| 
 puts avatar[:path]
end
</pre>
