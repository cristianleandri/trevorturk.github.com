<a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com/">Instant Domain Search</a> &mdash; what a great little app &mdash; this thing saved me a bit of time, and I think it's a great idea. The basic concept is that it applies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> to searching for domain names, which speeds up the process quite a bit. Then, the person who created it can make a buck (or whatever) if you buy your domain through clicking on one of his referral links.

<blockquote>This site is designed to help you find the right domain name. We don't offer computer-generated suggestions because we think people can outperform machines when using good tools.</blockquote>

Nice. <a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com/">Try it out &raquo;</a>

Also, I noticed that <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> has something faster than their normal search, if you look closely. Click the Quick Domain Search bar right above the login form, and you'll see what I mean. It's not as snappy as the Instant Domain Search site, but it's better than the alternative on Godaddy's site.
