There are a number of different ways to retrieve random items from a database in Rails, most of which have been discussed at length on the Rails wiki. According to <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoSelectRandomRecords">this article</a>, there are 3 preferred methods:

<ol>
<li>Select a Record by Random Offset</li>
<li>Randomize with the Database</li>
<li>Randomize with Ruby</li>
</ol>

For an in-depth look into these options, you can peruse <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/RandomAccessRecordsDiscussion">this discussion page</a>, which details some of the pros and cons of different strategies for randomization.

After trying out a few of the techniques that abound in this area, I stumbled across <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/7/helping-activerecord-finders-help-you">an article from Jamis Buck</a>, where he discusses a <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/08/01/whats-new-in-edge-rails-simply-restful-support-and-how-to-use-it">RESTful</a> way to approach the creation of custom finders. Although randomization isn't the focus of the article, he does provide a bit of guidance in that regard. His strategy uses Ruby for the randomization, and employs 2 light-weight queries. The first query gathers a list of valid ids. The second simply selects a single item using that (randomized) id.

So, I did a bit of <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/1/7/never-ever-cargo-cult">cargo-culting</a> and repurposing to achieve an efficient, database agnostic way to retrieve random items from a database using <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord</a>. Simply add the following to the model from which you'd like to be able to pull random records:

<pre lang="ruby">class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
  
  # ...
  
  def self.random
    ids = connection.select_all("SELECT id FROM widgets")
    find(ids[rand(ids.length)]["id"].to_i) unless ids.blank?
  end
  
end</pre>

Then, you can use the following bit of code in a controller like so:

<pre lang="ruby">class SomeController < ApplicationController
  
  # ...

  def some_action
    @widget = Widget.random
  end

end</pre>

And you've got a small and efficient "random finder" for use throughout your app. Lovely.

<b>Update</b> I just came across <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1274-patch-add-support-for-order-random-in-queries#ticket-1274-11">a comment from Rails Core member Koz</a> that provides an alternative that seems compelling at fist glance:
