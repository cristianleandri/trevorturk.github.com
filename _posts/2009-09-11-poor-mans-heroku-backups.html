Here's a quick and dirty way to <a href="http://docs.heroku.com/backups">back up</a> all of your <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>-powered databases using their <a href="http://adam.blog.heroku.com/past/2009/2/11/taps_for_easy_database_transfers/">Taps</a> gem with one easy command. It works well enough for my simple needs, but any improvements you've got would be most welcome!

Just add the following to your ~/.bash_profile, and you're good to go:

<b>Update:</b> I've posted a technique for enabling <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/2010/04/14/automated-heroku-backups/">automatic nightly PostgreSQL database backups from Heroku to Amazon S3</a> that may be of interest as well.
