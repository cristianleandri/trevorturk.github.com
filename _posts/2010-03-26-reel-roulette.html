<a href="http://reelroulette.net/">Reel Roulette</a> -- an easy way to find motion designers -- has just been launched. I'm really pleased with this one because it took so little time from concept to launch. 

It's based on an idea hatched with my buddy <a href="http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/">Nick</a> during the plane ride to SXSW Interactive a couple of weeks ago. 

He's been running around the world talking to students about how to <a href="http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/2009/02/presentation-how-to-be-creative-and-get-paid/">be creative and get paid</a>... but how do you get your work in front of the people that can hire you? 

After pondering this over a couple of beers at the Ginger Man and spending some time on <a href="http://chatroulette.com/">Chat Roulette</a> looking for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwJetox_tU">Piano Improve Guy</a>, we decided that we should put something together. Something small. Something quick. 

We recruited Nick's main man <a href="http://www.joshuaschaible.com/about">Joshua</a> and got down to work!

It started with a two-hour iChat session where we sorted out the details. This resulted in a lot of ideas, some tough decision making, and a pruned-down set of of to-do items that made it into our <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>. 

Before we'd even started, we decided to use an idea from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162/permissionmarket">Seth Godin's <i>Linchpin</i></a> and set some hard deadlines. An idea is one thing, a promise is another, but the prospect of paying your buddy $100 for missing a deadline is the real deal -- so we signed a makeshift contract. It turns out that embracing constraints is actually really powerful. Thanks for the advice, <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a>! ;)

So, once we'd sorted out our to-dos, Nick and Joshua worked up a design while I hacked out the backend using some of my favorite web tools like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>, and <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. 

Once I was done Nick and Josh applied the design, and we had a site up within about 30 hours of work between us. 

I'd say it's the fastest I've ever seen a site come together, and I'm really proud of what we've done in such a small amount of time.
