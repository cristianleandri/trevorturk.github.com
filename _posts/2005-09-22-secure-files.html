Announcing the very first <i>almost effortless</i> plugin: <b>Secure Files</b>. This plugin allows you to upload and download documents that are stored outside of your web document root for security purposes.

This is great for people using plugins like Registered Only, which you can read about here, that secure your Wordpress content (Posts, Pages, etc).

The problem with this is that your loose files arent protected - only the contents of your Wordpress database. So, any images or other documents you've uploaded are easily accessible to those who aren't authenticated via a plugin like Registered Only. This plugin aims to solve this problem.
