<img style="float:left;margin-right:15px;" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/almosteffortless/feed-bulge.jpg" alt="feed-bulge" />Lately, I've been getting really tired of opening up the old <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a> and finding over 300 items that I needed to get through. I know I'm not the only person out there feeling the pressure of information overload, but it's just getting to the point where I don't think it's possible to keep up with it all. I love keeping up with all of the news on the interwebernet, but man... 

<a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/">Paul</a> got me thinking about this with a post he made noting <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/08/08/an-ode-to-the-syndicated-lifestyle/">the move of his nearly all of his bookmarks</a> to his RSS reader:

<blockquote>No longer do I need to maintain 300 miscellaneous bookmarks that clutter my browser. I can throw those really random ones to del.icio.us, keep the daily-reads and private bookmarks in the bookmarks toolbar and direct the rest to an aggregator. Feeds have really changed the way that I browse in the past year that I have passionately been using RSS wherever it is to be found.</blockquote>

What I found works best for me is going the other way. 

Instead of adding more to my RSS reader, I took out the major offenders like <a href="http://www.digg.com/view/all/popular/today/">Digg</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a> and moved them into my browser bookmarks bar. (side note: I got rid of <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> all together.) I think that reading sites made up of links is more natural than scrolling through RSS items - and I've found it to be much quicker. The real benefit, though, is that there's less clutter obscuring the sites I read with less volume.

Another thing I decided to do was to stop saving feed items. Why save feed items for longer than they're in the feed? That's against the whole point of feeds: feeds are supposed to be fresh. 

Finally, and more generally, I'm doing my best to Fight the Urge to Read Everything in Front of Me. I'm also trying not to to catalogue, store, share, or archive everything I come across. There will always be a way to find that link again... If it was important anyway... If not, I figure it's better to just toss it and consider your life "simplified".
