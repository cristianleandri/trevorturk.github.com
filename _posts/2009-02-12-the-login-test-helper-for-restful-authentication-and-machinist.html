A recent <a href="http://www.themomorohoax.com/2009/02/11/when-to-use-a-bang-exclamation-point-after-rails-methods">blog post</a> reminded me that I should share a little test helper we've been using quite happily at the office lately. This trick works great with our extra-restful <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master">Restful Authentication</a> and fixture-free <a href="http://github.com/notahat/machinist/tree/master">Machinist</a> setup. 

It creates a new user with Machinst, and then logs the user in. We add a touch of convenience by returning the user object, and finish off by allowing you to pass in extra options if necessary. 

<pre lang="ruby">
def login!(options = {})
  user = User.make(options)
  @request.session[:user_id] = user.id
  user
end
</pre>

This allows for many little niceties in your tests:

<pre lang="ruby">
# login as a newly created user
login!

# login and keep the user around for assertions and whatnot:
user = login!

# login with admin privileges
login!(:admin => true)
</pre>

It's a small thing, but give it a try! I'm sure you'll like it.
