I'm pleased to present my submission to the <a href="http://coderack.org/">CodeRack</a> contest: <b>no-www</b>. 

This middleware catches requests that begin with “www” and redirects them to the more reasonable "non-www" address. 

For example: http://www.example.com -> http://example.com

While such redirects might better be performed from within an Apache or nginx config, some hosts (i.e. <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>) don't give you access to configure the server as such. 

If you're unfamiliar with the <i>no-www</i> movement, the philosophy is simple. Websites should have a canonical address. This address shouldn’t begin with “www” because the use of "www" is unnecessary and wasteful. See <a href="http://no-www.org/">http://no-www.org/</a> for details. 

And, without further ado:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/224812.js"></script>

If you know what <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org">Rack</a> is, you problably already know how to use this. Still, an example usage for a Rails app wouldn't hurt. Start by copying the above middleware into <i>lib/no_www.rb</i>. Then, configure your application to use the middleware by placing the following in <i>config/environment.rb</i>: 

<pre lang="ruby">
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.middleware.use “NoWWW” if RAILS_ENV == ‘production’
end</pre>

No more www.
