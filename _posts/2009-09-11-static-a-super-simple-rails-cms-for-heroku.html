Static is a super simple Rails CMS built for Heroku. It supports file uploads to S3, makes image thumbnails, lets you make pages, has an optional admin password, and a customizable application layout that supports erb. It's really easy to install and deploy to Heroku. If you have an S3 account, you can get up and running in under 5 minutes. 

I made this little app a few weekends back because it scratched a personal itch of mine. I maintain a few small "static" or "brochure" <a href="http://seemaxwork.com/">sites</a> <a href="http://psalmuno.com/">for</a> <a href="http://amandagad.com/">friends</a>, which means I get to do boring HTML updates whenever they have a new picture or video they want to add. I figured that I could do a little upfront work and let them to do the rest. So, I looked around for a simple Rails CMS, but I couldn't find anything simple enough. Thusly, Static was born. 

It doesn't do much for you, but that's the point. You get a really simple little Rails app that lets you add pages, upload stuff, and wrap everything in a layout that can be updated online. If you ever need to add any cool new functionality (like displaying recent Twitter updates?) you can do it using Ruby/Rails. No more lame old hacked-together PHP sites ;) Static's well-tested, 175 line code base could be the solid foundation for a site that grows over time. 

This thing does exactly and only what I need it to do, but I'm happy to accept patches and such. Give it a shot, fork away, and let me know if you have something good for me to pull.
