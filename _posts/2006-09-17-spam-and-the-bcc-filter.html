<p>Here's a quick tip for those of you dealing with SPAM in your email (read: everyone on Earth). Take a moment to create a filter to send email that doesn't include your email address in to <b>To:</b> or <b>CC:</b> fields to a special folder.</p>

<p>I had my Yahoo! email address set up to send Spam messages to the "Spam" folder, like I'm sure you do, but I found that this doesn't quite cut it. Adding another filter to reject email that I'm sent by way of BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) seems to be catching about half again as much Spam as the Yahoo Spam Guard (tm) alone.</p>

<p>You might miss the occasional mass message from a chronic email forwarding relative of yours, or perhaps some mass email marketing brochure about Chicago real estate or some such nonsense - but did you really want to read that crap anyway?</p>

<p>Witness <b>The Magical Filter</b> in all its glory!</p>

<p>That is all.</p>
