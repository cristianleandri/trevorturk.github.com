I'm proud to announce the release of another Wordpress plugin: <b>Mass Edit Pages</b>. This plugin will come in handy for those using their Wordpress install less as a Blog, and more as a CMS (Content Management System).

Basically, this will allow you to edit the Page Parent (post_parent) and Menu Order (menu_order) of many pages, on a single page. Thus, instead of clicking through each page (<i>page</i> after <i>page</i> after <i>page</i>) to change their order or parentage, you can get at all of the pages from one simple interface.

If you're leveraging the wonderful Wordpress as a CMS, I'm sure you're going to find that this plugin will save you a <i>ton</i> of time. Plus, I got to learn quite a bit about Wordpress internals while writing it. For example, the accessibility of the Wordpress database via the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpdb_Class">wpdb class</a>, which is somewhat amazing. Also, other plugin authors might take note of the way I've dealt with multidimensional arrays with regard to plugins. I'm sure that I didn't do things the 100% best way, but at least it's working!

Anyway, I hope you enjoy. Comments? Questions? Please visit the <a href="http://eldorado.heroku.com/forum/">Forum &raquo;</a>

<b>Update</b>: <a href="http://geheimwerk.de/">Jan</a> was nice enough to make a German version of the plugin, which I've made available from the <a href="http://almosteffortless.com/wordpress/mass-edit-pages/">download</a> page.
