I made a little Sinatra app called <a href="https://github.com/trevorturk/ghissues">ghissues</a>. It's a dashboard view of all issues in private repos in your organizations on GitHub.

Because GitHub gives you:

https://github.com/organizations/ORG_NAME/dashboard/pulls

...but not:

https://github.com/organizations/ORG_NAME/dashboard/issues

You can use it here:

<a href="https://ghissues.heroku.com/">https://ghissues.heroku.com/</a>

You can view the source and contribute here:

<a href="https://github.com/trevorturk/ghissues">https://github.com/trevorturk/ghissues</a>
