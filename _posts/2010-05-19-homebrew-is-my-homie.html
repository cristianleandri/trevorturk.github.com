If you're doing any kind of development on a Mac and you aren't using <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>, you're missing out. Homebrew is the best package manager for OS X by leaps and bounds. It makes it incredibly easy to install things like git, mysql, mongodb, node.js and <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula/">tons more</a>. All of the "Formula" are written in Ruby and hosted on GitHub, so it's easy to understand what's going on and to contribute. 

You can read more about it on the <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew">Homebrew home page</a> or the <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/homebrew-os-xs-missing-package-manager/">Engine Yard blog</a>, so I won't bore you with a long description here. Use it; you won't regret it.
