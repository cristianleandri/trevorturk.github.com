In an article entitled <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051103.html">It's Deja Vu All Over Again</a>, Robert X. Cringely <i>totally</i> gives us a shout-out! This guy is a visionary in the computers/technologies/internets world, in case you didn't know. Plus, he has this <i>crazy frog logo</i> going on, which is pretty sweet.

<blockquote>
We've Seen Microsoft's New Live Strategy Before... An upstart Internet company threatens Microsoft and the entire Windows platform. The basis of that threat is the new company's <b>almost effortless</b> command of Internet technology, which can be used to replace Windows with a browser-based architecture to supplant at will any and every part of the venerable operating system... [emphasis added]

Didn't you know we were down with PBS? Man, my mom - and all of moms I'm cool with - have been PBS members <i>since we were in the womb</i>, and maybe even before that! Plus, I just became a member of <a href="http://www.chicagopublicradio.org">Chicago public radio</a>, too. Let's hear it for public stuff!

Anyway, we here at this website you're looking at believe that we've got this so-called <b>almost effortless command of Internet technology</b>, and we're working hard to prove it. In case you didn't know, our <a href="http:/www.almosteffortless.com/about/">About page</a> has a certain comedic duo expounding on this same exact notion. See, I <i>knew</i> we were on to <i>something</i> with this domain name!
