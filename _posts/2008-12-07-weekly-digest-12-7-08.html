Here's the latest from your favorite providers of interesting links in a highly digestible weekly format:

<p><a href="http://www.isitfunnytoday.com/">IsItFunnyToday? Find out if your favorite comics are funny today</a>
<blockquote>This website (which, unfortunately, requires an http visit) lets users upvote and downvote the week's webcomics. A real time-saver if you're trying to keep abreast but don't feel like spending half an hour every morning using your browser to look at websites.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/7307">Google Contacts :: Thunderbird Add-ons</a>
<blockquote>Self explanatory: this Thunderbird .xpi will add your gmail contacts to your Thunderbird address books and keep everything in sync. If, like me, you're going around using a G1 and Thunderbird, you're basically indestructible now.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://cherrypeel.com/">cherrypeel.com</a>
<blockquote>cherrypeel.com came to my attention courtesy of a friend with a bad habit of passing along reddit links as if I wasn't eventually going to get around to them and see that he was merely passing off reddit links as his own discoveries. Nevertheless, cherrypeel--it's like reddit, but for music!--is a website where independent music is upvoted/downvoted Thunderdome stizz by users who are every bit as snarky and excitable as the irascible, pre-teen redditors you know and love.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sodaclubusa.com/">The Fountain Jet Home Soda Maker From Soda-Club</a>
<blockquote>I'm normally not a gadget enthusiast--if there's an MLM out there selling widgets based on anything but outrageous bullshit and misdirection, I'll eat my hat--but this is kind of awesome. Particularly if you're a hopeless, elbow-bending boozer and soda drinks are among your preferred liver-hardeners. Get one of these, a fridge that automatically makes chipped ice and one of those trays that lets you make shotglasses out of ice and you'll never have to leave the house again. Except for more hooch.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2008/12/06/re-engineyards-recent-post-about-phusion-passenger/">Re: EngineYard’s recent post about Phusion Passenger</a>
<blockquote>More interestingly however, is that even though Engine Yard claims to not have experience or expertise in Passenger, they seem to be perfectly capable of making some strong statements about it anyway as found on Ezra’s slides and Tom’s blog post.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.engineyard.com/2008/12/05/apache-passenger-vs-nginx-mongrel">Apache + Passenger -vs- nginx + mongrel</a>

If you do, the Terminal command below will enable path view in the Finder -- this means that you will see the directory path to the current folder you are browsing in the title bar, instead of only seeing the name of the current directory.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/12/03/real-advice-hurts">Real Advice Hurts</a>
<blockquote>...if the countless, dreary hours of resource-hunting and tip-scarfing have primarily produced more RSS subscriptions and a giant ass print on your couch, maybe it’s time to...</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=386036">RubyGem is from Mars, AptGet is from Venus</a>

To this end I've created Visual Event to help track events which are subscribed to DOM nodes.</blockquote></p>
