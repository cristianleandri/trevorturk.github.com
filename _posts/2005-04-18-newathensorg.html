As some loyal readers (ha!) of this totally lame site may have noticed, I haven't been writing anything here for quite some time. Perhaps, you might think to yourself, perhaps Trevor has died. For if Trevor isn't dead, he certainly is spending a fair amount of time on the Internet, no? And were he spending a lot of time on the Internet, he ought to be doing some lame-ass web-related thing. Am I right? Yes, I know I am. Well, I have good news - I'm not dead, and I have been doing a little bit of lame Internet-related stuff. Ch-check it out:
