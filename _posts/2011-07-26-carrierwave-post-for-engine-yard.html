<p><a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave">CarrierWave</a> is self-described as a "classier solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and other Ruby web frameworks." Although I've head it referred to as "a new kid on the block" it's actually quite an old gem. The initial checkin is from August 2008 and the first release was in March 2009. The original name was Merb::Upload and it started without support Rails.</p>

<p>The fact that CarrierWave began its life as a Merb plugin may help explain its modularity, flexibility, and extensibility.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/geemus/fog">Fog</a>, it has support for Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud Files, and Google Storage for Developers. It also supports plain old file storage and MongoDB's GridFS store. There's ORM support available for ActiveRecord, Mongoid, Datamapper, Sequel, Mongo Mapper, CouchDB, and more. Image processors are available for RMagick, ImageScience, MiniMagick.</p>

<p>Let's see this modularity first hand by building up a CarrierWave uploader from scratch.</p>

<p>To begin with, we'll install CarrierWave:</p>

<pre>
  gem install carrierwave
</pre>

<p>Then, we can make the world's shortest uploader:</p>

<pre>
  require 'carrierwave'

  class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
    storage :file
  end
</pre>

<p>Even at this point, we can start saving files:</p>

<pre>
  file = File.open('example.jpg')
  uploader = MyUploader.new
  uploader.store!(file)
</pre>

<p>The uploader houses the logic for uploading files in self-contained classes, so this is all we need to get started.</p>

<p>It's dead easy to store files on Amazon S3 with Fog. We just have to configure our fog_credentials and set the uploader's storage to fog:</p>

<pre>
  CarrierWave.configure do |config|
    config.fog_credentials = {
      :provider               => 'AWS',
      :aws_access_key_id      => 'xxx',
      :aws_secret_access_key  => 'yyy'
    }
    config.fog_directory  = 'zzz'
  end

  class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
    storage :fog
  end
</pre>

<p>Configuring Fog to use Rackspace Cloud Files or Google Storage for Developers is so easy I hesitate to even mention it. This is all we'd need to change to use Rackspace:</p>

<pre>
  CarrierWave.configure do |config|
    config.fog_credentials = {
      :provider           => 'Rackspace',
      :rackspace_username => 'xxx',
      :rackspace_api_key  => 'yyy'
    }
    config.fog_directory = 'zzz'
  end
</pre>

<p>Suppose we want to have image thumbnails. First, we need to install RMagick:</p>

<pre>
  gem install rmagick
</pre>

<p>Then, we just add a version block to our uploader:</p>

<pre>
  require 'carrierwave'
  require 'rmagick'

  class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
    include CarrierWave::RMagick

    version :thumb do
      process :resize_to_fill => [200,200]
    end

    storage :file
  end
</pre>

<p>This has all been so easy, though. Let's give ourselves a challenge and create an app that uses CarrierWave, <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, and <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a> with <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.
  
<p>To begin, we'll we need to install these new gems:</p>

<pre>
  gem install sinatra sqlite3 sequel carrierwave-sequel
</pre>

<p>Then, we'll create the app. It's so small (55 lines) that I'll just include the whole thing here:</p>

<pre>
  require 'carrierwave'
  require 'sinatra'
  require 'sqlite3'
  require 'sequel'
  require 'carrierwave/sequel'

  # database setup

  DB = Sequel.sqlite

  DB.create_table :uploads do
    String :file
  end

  # uploader

  class MyUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
    storage :file
  end

  # model

  class Upload < Sequel::Model
    mount_uploader :file, MyUploader
  end

  # sinatra app

  get '/' do
    @uploads = Upload.all
    erb :index
  end

  post '/' do
    upload = Upload.new
    upload.file = params[:image]
    upload.save
    redirect to('/')
  end

  __END__

  @@ index
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;form action="/" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="file" name="image" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="Upload" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
      &lt;% @uploads.each do |upload| %&gt;
        &lt;img src="&lt;%= upload.file.url %&gt;" /&gt;
      &lt;% end %&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>The app can be run like so:</p>

<pre>
  ruby example.rb
</pre>

<p>There's a lot more I could have covered in this post, but my hope is that this brief illustration of CarrierWave's modularity, flexibility, and extensibility will appeal to you as it did to me.</p>

<p>If you're ready for more, check out <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave/">the readme</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave/wiki">the wiki</a>. I'm sure you'll enjoy using CarrierWave as much as I have!</p>
