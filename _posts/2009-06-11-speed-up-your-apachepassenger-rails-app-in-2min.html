Here's a quick tip for speeding up your Apache/Passenger powered Rails app. It'll take you about 2 minutes, and I guarantee you'll notice the speed-up. 

<ul>
<li>SSH onto your VPS</li>
<li>Run the following commands: "a2enmod expires" and "a2enmod deflate"</li>
</ul>

Now, open up your Apache vhost config for your Rails app. Add the following:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/128392.js"></script>

Then, restart Apache by running: "/etc/init.d/apache2 restart"

This will gzip your html, css, and javascript. It'll also add far future expires headers for the appropriate cacheable filetypes. There's no downside, and it only takes a second. Bang for buck. 

<b>Edit</b>: Check the comments for some possible downsides... ;)
