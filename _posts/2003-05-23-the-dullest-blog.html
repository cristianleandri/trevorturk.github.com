I think I posted this before, but its still funny: <a title="The dullest blog in the world" href="http://www.wibsite.com/wiblog/dull/">The dullest blog in the world</a>. For example:
<blockquote>
Walking along at a steady pace - May 17<br />I needed to get somewhere and decided to walk there. I wasn't particularly early or particularly late, so I walked along at a steady pace.
