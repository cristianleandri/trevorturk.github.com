<blockquote>The entire Rails request cycle is around 4ms. This may have shaved off 1/2ms, which isn’t going to be that big a deal for any app, but like I said, a few more of these optz and the full Rails request cycle will moot Metal.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.contrast.ie/blog/gently-exceeding-expectations/">Gently exceeding expectations</a>
<blockquote>Exceeding expectations is the point of this post, but if you go too far, you don’t just exceed them, you change them. The next time your client comes back for more work, not only will they not believe you when you said that you haven’t completed the work in half the time, they’ll be disappointed that you didn’t go to the same effort as before. It’s a vicious, unfair reality.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>...people could share game objects by dragging them into chat windows... plans for the game fizzled out the engineers created a Flash application for real-time chat plus file-sharing with a particular emphasis on image-sharing... people were interested in the sharing part more than the real-time part... in yet another upheaval they rewrote the Flash application as a regular website and lo, Flickr was born.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.therailsway.com/2009/1/6/requests-per-second">Requests Per Second</a>
<blockquote>Durations are a much more useful, and more honest, metric when comparing performance changes in your applications. Requests per second is too wide-spread for us to stop using it entirely, but please don’t use it when talking about performance of your web applications or libraries. [Fantastic to see this blog back in action!]</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Tutorials tend to go by the assumption that the listed code works as advertised, and that you’ll be massively productive. That rarely happens to be the case. There are many times when little edge cases make the code blow up in strange ways. Don’t panic, just learn how to debug the errors and fix the issue. I don’t mean just commenting out enough code until it starts working, but actually finding the root of the error.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://danbenjamin.com/articles/2009/01/regarding-the-personal-web">Regarding The Personal Web</a>
<blockquote>I don’t think it’s possible to have a successful presence or brand today without being a part of the social networks, without contributing more than just one kind of content, without using multiple channels. But I have no plans to stop writing and publishing here. Actually, I still feel like I’m just getting started.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>I thought I’d share my personal list of things you need to be careful of as you go from 1.8 to 1.9. This is not a list of changes; it’s a list of changes that you really need to know about to get your 1.8 code to work in 1.9, things that have a relatively high likelihood of biting you if you don’t know about them.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>We’ve been rotating some headlines and subheads on the Highrise signup page to see if they have an effect on signups. Answer: They do, sometimes significantly. [Amazing that these small changes could make such a huge difference!]</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>China, re: Internet censorship, has once again FAIL'd /mightily/.  The complete and utter failure of the Chinese government hivemind to grasp the basic necessities of privacy and how fundamental they are for the survival of a civilization would be hilarious if it weren't certain to end in buckets of tears and bathtubs of blood.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://androidguys.com/?p=3375">Make it All Opt-in and Stop Worrying So Much | AndroidGuys</a>
<blockquote>AndroidGuys' Scott Webster is completely off-base (and by &quot;off-base&quot; I mean &quot;dumbfoundingly ignorant of the basic human right to privacy and the increasingly urgent battle between the privately owned Mega Corps and citizens for control of public spaces and resources into which we were all conscripted when Phil Knight declared open war on us in the 70's&quot;) in his blithe response to the growing concern among the dudes at the Digital Democracy project re: Android's capacity to a.) gather user info and b.) facilitate location-specific advertisements, but he does provide a handy entree to the debate.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Yeah, this was on reddit, but it really is too hilarious to pass up: a guide for (novice) Japanese tourists by (seasoned) Japanese tourists about how to get by in America. Mostly valuable as one of those exercises in trying to look at yourself the way that other people are looking at you.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>My new band just released our debut EP. In the course of the last two months we've a.) configured a vanilla WP install (with Disciple theme) to suit our needs, b.) set up a mediawiki install for our private, back-end stuff and c.) recorded a debut EP. The release part for same is this weekend. The Sweetheart Brigade so far has been, for me, an exercise in applying GTD principles/tools and the Linux admin and desktop publishing skills I've learned as an office drone to a meaningful, real-world project.</blockquote></p>
