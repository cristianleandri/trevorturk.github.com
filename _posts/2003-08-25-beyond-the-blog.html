<a title="A Whole Lotta Features" href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/features.blah/entry/007162">A Whole Lotta Features</a> is an article that details easy ways that you can move your static page content over into the moveabletype interface. <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/001656.php">Brad Choate</a> talks about some of the advantages, such as being able to edit your static pages online without ftp and whatnot, having your entire site be searchable, and the ability to add comments and trackbacks on every page. Seems like a really good idea, and I think I'm going to move my content over pretty soon.
