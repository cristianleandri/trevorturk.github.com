I'm working on a side project that lets people share embeddable videos with a follower/following system a la Twitter. You can see a rough example of the setup I'm using in this <a href="http://sr3d.github.com/GithubFinder/?utm_source=bml&user_id=trevorturk&repo=tweets">old demo app</a>. The basic idea is that each <i>user</i> has a <i>feed</i> of <i>posts</i> created by other users that they <i>follow</i>.

So far, I've found that having a <i>feed_items</i> table that stores posts on a per-user basis makes the most sense. If you drop an index in there, it seems speedy enough for my needs. Here's a simplified example of the relevant portion of the schema: 

<script src="http://gist.github.com/566272.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>

Now, if you're going to show a user their "feed" you might do something like this:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/566272.js?file=gistfile2.rb"></script>

The only problem is that, even with those fancy <i>includes</i>, you're still querying 3 different tables:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/566272.js?file=gistfile3.txt"></script>

So, I started experimenting with storing attributes of the post and associated user information directly in the feed_items table. I played around with Active Record's <i>serialize</i> method (<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">link</a>), but it didn't seem like the right fit.

Here's what I came up with yesterday. I think it's a pretty good start:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/566272.js?file=gistfile4.rb"></script>

Essentially, I'm just pushing a cached copy of the post (including the associated user) into the feed_items table, using JSON. This way, we can get away with a single query for the user's feed_items:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/566272.js?file=gistfile5.txt"></script>

I'm curious to hear what other people think about this, and if there are smarter ways to accomplish the same goal.
