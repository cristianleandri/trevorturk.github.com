While something like <a href="http://github.com/norman/friendly_id">friendly_id</a> sounds good, I think it's a bit much for generating pretty urls. 

This is from the friendly_id README:

<blockquote>
Using FriendlyId, it's easy to make your application use URL's like:

<pre>http://example.com/states/washington</pre>

...instead of:

<pre>http://example.com/states/4323454</pre>
</blockquote>

A noble goal, to be sure. But once you starting digging into the gem, you realize that it provides a table of it's own for tracking this stuff, plus it's worried about what version of Active Record you're using. 

I don't know about you, but I think it's much easier to roll your own for this kind of thing. Less dependencies is generally a win in my experience. 

Anyway, here's a gist of a diff showing all of the steps necessary to generate a "friendly id" or "pretty url" in one go. It's short enough that I think you'll be able to sort it out for yourself:
