<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/almosteffortless/feedlounge.jpeg" alt="feedlounge" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px;"/>One of the two creators of the ambitious <a href="http://www.feedlounge.com">FeedLounge</a> web-based RSS reader has left the team. You can read <a href="http://www.alexking.org/blog/2006/08/16/ive-left-feedlounge/">the announcement</a> (or <a href="http://feedlounge.com/blog/2006/08/16/alex-leaves-feedlounge/">here</a>), which makes it sound as though there was some internal tension or something on how best to move the project forward. 

<blockquote>Ultimately, the choice for me to leave was very hard, but one I felt had to be made. Despite hard work and the best of intentions, the level of service we were providing to our FeedLounge customers was just not something I was comfortable putting my name behind.</blockquote>

Utimately, however, the problem with Feedlounge is something I <a href="http://forums.feedlounge.com/viewtopic.php?id=269">pointed out</a> just about a year ago. <b>The site is just too slow</b>. 

<blockquote>I'm sorry to report that I'm giving up on FeedLounge (at least for now). Things are just moving too slow for me, and I'm heading back to NetNewsWire.

I love the idea of an RSS reading web app, but after using FeedLounge exclusively for a while, I opened up NNW and realized that I had to move back to a client side app.

Really, I can just get through my feeds faster that way. Plus, there is the ability to refresh feeds on demand. Also, the pricing seems like it'll be more than the 24.95 flat charge on NNW, which is understandable, but also... well... more!

I'll try FeedLounge again once you guys get the extra equipment that's supposed to make things faster, but I just wanted to give you an honest opinion of the service up to this point.

Thanks again!</blockquote>

Quite a shame, because there is a lot of great stuff in FeedLounge, and Alex seems like a great developer. Maybe <a href="http://dotnot.org/">Scott</a> will be able to turn things around, but I'm not too sure this is a good sign.
