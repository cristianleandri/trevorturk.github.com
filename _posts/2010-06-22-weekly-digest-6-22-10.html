<blockquote><p>My research turned up a lot of work by Ilya Grigorik and Mike Perham that pushed toward this goal. Rack/Fiber-Pool by Mike is a piece of Rack middleware that runs each request in it's own Fiber, allowing the possibility of easy cooperative scheduling in Rack applications.

<blockquote><p>You are sure right about the importance of a good story in movies. Unfortunately, it's not as easy as it sounds. It takes a lot of work (and rework, and rework and rework) to get it right. And even then quite often we're not 100% pleased. As John Lasseter likes to say, our films don't get finished, they just get released.</p></blockquote>
