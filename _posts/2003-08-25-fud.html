<p>Ever wonder: what does <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hills/9267/fuddef.html">FUD</a> mean?</p>
<blockquote>
FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. It is a marketing technique used when a competitor launches a product that is both better than yours and costs less, i.e. your product is no longer competitive. Unable to respond with hard facts, scare-mongering is used via 'gossip channels' to cast a shadow of doubt over the competitors offerings and make people think twice before using it.
