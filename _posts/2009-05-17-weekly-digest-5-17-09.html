<p><a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2009/05/13/interview-with-ian-hickson-editor-of-the-html-5-specification/">Interview with Ian Hickson, editor of the HTML 5 specification</a>
<blockquote>You’ve heard it’s coming in 2012. Or maybe 2022. It’s certainly not ready yet, but some parts are already in browsers now so for the standards-savvy developers, the future is worth investigating today. Ian “Hixie” Hickson, editor of the HTML 5 specification, hopes that the spec will go to Last Call Working Draft in October this year.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/the-mega-railsconf-2009-round-up-1757.html">The Mega RailsConf 2009 Round Up</a>
<blockquote>A week ago, RailsConf 2009 kicked off in Las Vegas. As usual, it didn't fall short on drama, interesting sessions, and inspiration for the 1000+ attendees. This post is an after-event summary and long-term source of links to the best RailsConf 2009 related content found so far.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1728-nuts-bolts-campfire-loves-erlang">Nuts & Bolts: Campfire loves Erlang</a>
<blockquote>Erlang definitely isn’t a replacement for Rails, but it is a fantastic addition to our collective toolbox for problems that Rails wasn’t designed to address. It’s always easier to work with the grain than against it, and adding more tools makes that more likely.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines">Tango Icon Theme Guidelines</a>
<blockquote>The Tango icon theme's goal is to make applications not seem alien on any desktop. A user running a multiplatform application should not have the impression that the look is unpolished and inconsistent with what he or she is used to. While this isn't about merging styles of all desktop systems, we do aim to not be drastically different on each platform.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5240827/rightzoom-makes-the-os-x-maximize-button-more-like-windows">RightZoom Makes the OS X Maximize Button More Like Windows</a>
<blockquote>Mac OS X only: System utility RightZoom runs in the background and modifies the OS X maximize behavior to fill the whole screen—perfect for readers that recently made the switch to Mac.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/158-factories-not-fixtures">Railscasts - Factories not Fixtures</a>
<blockquote>Fixtures are external dependencies which can make tests brittle and difficult to read. In this episode I show a better alternative using factories to generate the needed records. [I prefer Machinist to Factory Girl, but this is a particularly good episode all around.]</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/4932f7b38f72104819022abca0c952ba6f9888cb">db/seeds.rb in Rails</a>
<blockquote>Added db/seeds.rb as a default file for storing seed data for the database. Can be loaded with rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup). (This is also known as the "Stop Putting Gawd Damn Seed Data In Your Migrations" feature) [DHH]</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.matasano.com/log/1674/the-security-implications-of-google-native-client/">The Security Implications Of Google Native Client</a>
<blockquote>This is a really cool from Matasano about how things like ActiveX and Java work from the perspective of someone trying to execute compiled code from a remote source without giving away the whole store, security-wise. Nice pictures, very informative.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.debianadmin.com/how-to-add-date-and-time-to-your-bash-history-file.html">How to Add Date And Time To Your Bash History file -- Debian Admin</a>
<blockquote>This is a neat one-liner for your .bashrc that just might make your .bash_history a little more searchable. Add it to your custom .bashrc lines.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.irbs.net/internet/postfix/0608/1651.html">Postfix main.cf analysis</a>
<blockquote>Here's the setup: the one dude pastes his postconf -n and the other dude does through it, telling him what's what. Kind of a cross between a postmortem and an x-ray. Useful to test your postfix knowledge/skills.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://seerofsouls.com/wiki/How-Tos/SplitScreenVi">SoS Wiki - - Split Screen Vi</a>
<blockquote>If you use vi/vim and you don't do split screen, you are, in the immortal words of whatever Internet meme, doing it wrong. Study up!</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/set-gmail-as-default-mail-client-in-ubuntu/">Set Gmail as Default Mail Client in Ubuntu :: the How-To Geek</a>
<blockquote>This is a neat little trick for writing a line or two of bash that will allow you to use gmail (via firefox) as your default email client in a gnome environment. It wouldn't take much to adapt the instructions for other desktop environments. (Props to Artie for sending this my way)</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/957">Reports: Thief holds Virginia medical data ransom</a>
<blockquote>I guess, technically, that since I'm on the side of the law by virtue of my professional situation, I ought to regard this as terrifying or reprehensible or something. But you gotta admit: something about the idea of a blackhat utterly pwning someone's network to the extent of the pwnage described here is really, really exciting.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/postfix-backup-mx-server-anti-spam/">Postfix Backup MX eMail Server Anti-Spam Configuration</a>
<blockquote>The English is a little messy on this one, but the conf text is right on. This is a nice little list of basic (yet above and beyond "stock") config options for reducing shenanigans and closing commonly exploited gaps.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/4819">Restore a single table from a large MySQL backup</a>
<blockquote>I'm not sure that I understand the ruby syntax completely, but people are passing this link around, so this is my obligatory bump.</blockquote></p>
