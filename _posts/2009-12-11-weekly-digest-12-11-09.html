This time I have an excuse for the non-weekly nature of the weekly digest... I've been traveling! Please do <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trevorturk/">check out some photos</a> if you're interested on that sort of thing.

<p><a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Nov/23/node/">Node.js is genuinely exciting</a>
<blockquote>I don’t see myself switching all of my server-side development over to JavaScript, but Node has definitely earned a place in my toolbox. It shouldn’t be at all hard to mix Node in to an existing server-side environment—either by running both behind a single HTTP proxy (being event-based itself, nginx would be an obvious fit) or by putting Node applications on a separate subdomain. Node is a tempting option for anything involving comet, file uploads or even just mashing together potentially slow loading web APIs. Expect to hear a lot more about it in the future.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>...much as you and I may enjoy being encouraged through recognition and praise and dislike being saddened by rejection or indifference... deriving personal value from these transactions... is just plain faulty thinking, of the sort that makes otherwise capable, centred people all loopy and weird.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>In a short span of just a couple of years, the Ruby VM space has evolved to more than just a handful of choices: MRI, JRuby, IronRuby, MacRuby, Rubinius, MagLev, REE and BlueRuby. In fact, keeping up with all of the most recent developments within each VM is now easily a full-time job. For that reason, and with RubyConf ‘09 in full swing, let’s take a quick survey of the space and where it’s taking us.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/">Caching Tutorial for Web Authors and Webmasters</a>
<blockquote>A Web cache sits between one or more Web servers (also known as origin servers) and a client or many clients, and watches requests come by, saving copies of the responses — like HTML pages, images and files (collectively known as representations) — for itself. Then, if there is another request for the same URL, it can use the response that it has, instead of asking the origin server for it again.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://howsoftwareisbuilt.com/2009/11/09/interview-with-ezra-zygmuntowicz-engine-yard/">Interview with Ezra Zygmuntowicz – Engine Yard</a>
<blockquote>The cloud providers are splitting into a few camps.  On one side, you have companies like Amazon that offer infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and Google who offers platform as a service (PaaS).  PaaS offers rapid development, and no server administration, but it locks you into a specific provider. Enter Engine Yard, a company that's enhancing Ruby on Rails to run on on top of arbitrary IaaS.  In this interview Ezra Zygmuntowicz paints the picture.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a dizzying proliferation of credentials, keys, ids, usernames, certificates, passwords, and codes which are used to access and control various account and service features and functionality.

<p><a href="http://blogs.bigfish.tv/adam/2009/06/14/swfupload-jquery-plugin/">SWFUpload jQuery Plugin</a>
<blockquote>When I first stumbled across SWFUpload about two years ago I was impressed by how easy it was to implement. However, their example code has always bugged me as being rather crap, having to assign a separate global event handler for each event, and the lack of multiple handlers for a single event.</blockquote></p>
